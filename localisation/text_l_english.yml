 asian_musketeerDESCR: "Asian armies equipped with lighter and handier muskets, replacing the older arquebus."
 austrian_grenzerDESCR: "After the conquest of Hungary and Croatia in the 18th century, Austria formed a new type of unit called Grenzer (which translated means Borderers) to defend the borders of their newly conquered territories against the Ottomans. The men were recruited from the local population and were given land in return for their military service. Grenzer regiments were considered light infantry. They mostly fought in a skirmishing role but could also function as infantry of the line."
 austrian_hussarDESCR: "For a long time in Western Europe Cavalry was the prince of the battlefield. The heavily armored knights would deliver murderous cavalry charges. However in the East, opponents like the Ottoman Turks, who came from a steppe tradition, had lighter armed cavalry which was more suitable for skirmishing. These units showed their worth at the battle of Adrianople when the last great crusade (with the cream of Latin nobility) were shattered by the Ottoman light cavalry and Janissaries. To counter this the Hungarian army had a number of units termed Hussars which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their Ottoman opponents. However the units that first arrived in the west were not the light Hungarian Hussars, but the heavier Polish Winged Hussars which were a mixture of orthodox cavalry and light raiding Cavalry."
 austrian_jaegerDESCR: "In Germany in the 18th century a new type of light infantry came into being, Called Jaeger (Hunters). Jaeger were used for reconnaissance and skirmishing. At first they were recruited from huntsmen, gamekeepers and foresters. Most of them were excellent riflemen and were therefore often used as snipers, who could inflict great losses amongst enemy officers. Later Jaeger became a generic name for all kinds of light infantry. Jaeger troops were often hired as mercenaries by other nations, such as Great Britain who used them in the American Revolution."
 austrian_tercioDESCR: "The Tercio, or Spanish Square, was a mixed formation of pikemen and musketeers developed by the Spanish General Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba. The victory of the Spanish armies at Pavia (1525) would lead to its domination of the European battlefield for 100 years. The early Tercios contained anywhere from 50-70% pikemen. However, the Tercio were still evolving and through experimentation it was found that the number of pikemen required could be reduced. These late tercios could have as little as 25% pikemen leading to a massive increase in the formations' firepower."
 austrian_white_coatDESCR: "Having its beginning on the Habsburg military frontier fighting the Ottoman cavalry based armies. The White Coats were drilled and equipped primarily to resist cavalry charges.

 aztec_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "The introduction of gunpowder weapons into the new world by the Europeans did not change the overall tactics of new world warfare, only the technology used. The hill musketeer remained a primarily defensive unit, but the tactics used did more damage to enemy morale than the mountain warrior."
 aztec_hill_warfareDESCR: "The hardy hill warrior was not immune to technological change. With new weapons and tactics, these soldiers began to evolve from an offensive unit to a unit that placed a higher premium on defense. However, the unit's main means of victory was to hit the enemy's morale."

 british_squareDESCR: "During the war of the Austrian Succession, Austria was facing a serious defeat. Silesia had already been lost to Prussia and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The loose order of infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. However there were those that totally rejected the skirmisher concept and went for rigid linear tactics. Christened Square Infantry due to the formation they assumed when defending against cavalry. These were tightly disciplined units trained to fire their muskets at a high rate and fire by platoon which meant that rather than use the single volley and reload style during combat, these units would always have a platoon discharging their muskets. The deadly ripple fire could break any assault. However, rigid linear tactics made these units less mobile and more defensive."
 british_hussarDESCR: "As Cavalry became more specialized, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the Polish Hussar that had first entered European warfare and more like the Hungarian Original. The ability of the light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harass them, overrun their artillery positions and when they were beaten, pursue them."

The design of this late medieval ship combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense."
 carrackDESCR: "The design of the carrack, a late medieval ship, combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense. Some carracks such as the English vessel 'Henri Grâce à Dieu' weighed more than 1,000 tons, had large fore and aft castles, and could be considered as the greatest warships of their time."
 caravelDESCR: "The caravel was a small, very maneuverable ship which could sail with a high precision on long discovery journeys. Although designs varied, a caravel had a foresail, a square mainsail and lateen mizzen. Its smaller size limited the number of guns onboard, but it also meant that this light ship could explore shallow coastal waters and estuaries. Vasco Da Gama, Cabot, Columbus and Magellan used caravels during their late 15th century and early 16th century voyages."

 durrani_swivelDESCR: "Cavalry units mounted with highly portable swivel cannons on their backs, allowing the troops to fire over their own infantry."
 dutch_mauricianDESCR: "In the 16th century, the musket (a handheld firearm) became commonplace, but they were very slow to reload. Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 16th century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Maurice of Nassau who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Dutch troops in the Eighty Years' War. His development of military strategy and tactics made the Dutch army the most modern in Europe."
 early_frigateDESCR: "With the increasing overseas trade, there was a need for a fast escort vessel to provide safe journey. The early frigates were developed for this. They were smaller, leaner ships of war with one gun deck, and provided protection from piracy in dangerous waters."

And it became one of the most commonly used ships in the 16th and 17th century. The standard design wasn't armed but when needed it could be armed with cannons and serve as auxiliary vessels."
 french_carabinierDESCR: "The Carabiniers first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiniers main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 french_caracolleDESCR: "In the late 16th and early 17th century the most common combat formation for western European cavalry was the Caracole, which could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged frontally against the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 french_cuirassierDESCR: "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that emerged in the late 15th century. This type of cavalry was armored from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, the Cuirass from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock-cavalry and were in use during almost the whole time span focused upon in this game."
 french_bluecoatDESCR: "Having its origins in the French armies of Louis XIV. The Blue Coat infantry displays special elan on the attack. Perfect for leaders who believe that the offensive will always triumph over the defensive."
 french_dragoonDESCR: "In the 17th century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 french_impulseDESCR: "During the war of the Austrian Succession, Austria was facing a serious defeat. Silesia had already been lost to Prussia and total defeat was not far away. In order to help turn the tide of battle, irregular units for the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 frigateDESCR: "As time passed, the frigate evolved. It became larger and heavily armed, sometimes with two gun decks. The frigate's combination of speed and firepower meant that it could outrun any ship with more guns and outgun any faster ships. The fleet built by the Commonwealth of England in the 1650s consisted almost exclusively of frigates."
 gaelic_free_shooterDESCR: "The development of better firearms forced a change in tactics for the Gaelic mercenaries. These hardy warriors would now await the first volley from the enemy and then unleash their irresistible charge."
 gaelic_galloglaighDESCR: "The galloglaigh were mercenary bands from the Hebrides who mixed traditional Gaelic and Norse styles of warfare to great effect. Like many Gaelic warriors before them, the galloglaigh used the two-handed battle-axe, but were also well-armored in the Norse style with chain mail and helmets. They appeared in Ireland from the mid thirteenth century and soon became highly sought-after warriors in the service of the great Irish chiefs, right through to the sixteenth century. The Galloglaigh fought alongside their retainers in what was known as a 'spar', consisting of the warrior, his kern (a gaelic squire armed with pike or javelin) and his horse-boy (armed with a shortbow or a sheaf of darts). Collectively these spars would group in war-bands, or Corrughadh, which could number over a hundred strong. The galloglaigh were feared by the English as, whilst no match for a heavy medieval army in the open field, they proved a deadly force in small, close confrontations. As a result they were often used by Irish lords as shock troops in ambush situations. These Hebridean warriors did also find success on the open battlefield, most notably at Bannockburn in 1314."
 gaelic_mercenaryDESCR: "As gunpowder weaponry and drill techniques spread through Europe the traditional Scottish and Irish methods of warfare began to become obsolete - the time of the war bands and the galloglaigh was coming to an end. However Scottish and Irish mercenaries were still feared as fighters, especially by the invading English armies. Those who adapted to the new techniques were highly valued for their bravery and courage, notably the Redshanks of Scotland and the Buanadha (quartered men) of Ireland. After the 16th century many Scottish and Irish mercenaries could also be found in armies throughout Europe, notably during the Thirty Years War."
 galleassDESCR: "The galleass was an adaptation of the large merchant galley to counter the increasing use of man-of-war. Larger than the galley, the galleass had about 32 oar pairs, each oar manned by up to five man. As an answer to the men-of-war's armament and higher sides, the galleass had forecastles and aftcastles and gundecks above the rowers. This extra weight meant that they also had to rely more on sails, and were slower and less maneuverable compared to galleys. Like the galley, the galleass went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 galleonDESCR: "A large, usually three-masted sailing ship originally designed as a warship but later on used primarily for trade and commerce."
 galleyDESCR: "With roots back to the ancient ships of the antiquity, the galley remained the prime choice for Mediterranean naval warfare until the 16th century. The galley was primarily propelled by oars, usually about 25 pairs manned by up to three men each. This meant that they were less dependent on wind gauge compared to sailing ships, and their maneuverability made them a feared adversary. Eventually, the galley went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century."
 germanized_pikeDESCR: "When the Goths defeated the Romans at the battle of Adrianople, it heralded a new era in European warfare. Cavalry became the dominant force on the battlefield and infantry relegated to supplying a base for Cavalry to maneuver round. The English victories in the Hundred Years War, although with infantry armies, relied on defensive tactics. However the Swiss Pikemen of the late 15th century gave infantry an offensive role once again. This was quickly noticed by countries in Eastern Europe and German mercenaries were invited over to teach these new tactics."
 han_bannerDESCR: "Ming infantry troops armed with muskets that were incorporated into the banner system originally created by the Manchus during the 17th century."
 heavy_frigateDESCR: "Two decked vessels normally carrying about 40 guns."
 houfniceDESCR: "It is believed modern howitzers have their name from the Houfnice artillery developed by the Hussites in the 15th century. These short barreled guns were mounted on wagons and used on the field of battle to fire balls and canisters in support of the infantry."
 huron_arquebusierDESCR: "The Tomahawk Warrior had a strong emphasis on fire tactics even before the introduction of gunpowder. Embracing the benefits of these weapons, the Native American Arquebusier put strong emphasis on offensive fire and cohesion in combat. It was not as effective at shock action as the offensive musketeer."
 inca_mountain_warfareDESCR: "As new weapons and tactics became available the hardy mountain warriors began to improve. These warriors still placed a premium of defense, relying on their staying power for victory. The improvements in armor and training made victory over these units a tough undertaking."
 irish_chargeDESCR: "The linear descendants of the Gaelic mercenaries of early eras. These units placed maximum emphasis on infantry charges to kill and unnerve their enemies. Their charge could be more devastating than the cavalry of the era making them fearsome in attack."
 iroquois_rifle_scoutDESCR: "The Rifle Scout is a unit that specializes in harassment of the enemy. This unit may not be able to last as long in combat as a more disciplined unit. However these warriors are excellent marksmen and their prowess with the rifle can cause some serious damage to the enemy."
 italian_condottaDESCR: "Condotta is the Italian word for 'contract' and it was used to describe the mercenary units that fought mostly in Italy for the various city-states. The leaders of a Condotta regiment were called Condottiere. The most famous amongst them were Sir John Hawkwood, Francesco Sforza and Bartolomeo Colleoni. Condotta were not very loyal to their employers often switching sides because of higher pay. When Condotta fought each other they also made deals to not harm each other too much and war in Italy often became a sort of theater. Condotta regiments consisted of armored knights and heavy and light infantry and crossbowmen. The Condotta had a monopoly on warfare in Italy which meant that they still used old weapons and tactics when the other European armies already had switched to infantry consisting of musketeers and pikemen."
 japanese_archerDESCR: "The Asian archers were the most important force in Asian battles during this era. The bows were typically made of bamboo but generally longer than the European ones."
 japanese_footsoldierDESCR: "The foot soldiers were the lowest form of warriors within the hierarchy of the time. They consisted of commoners and the lower class nobles, and were the mainstay of the ruler's army. At first, the foot soldiers were only mercenaries and adventurers, and were paid with looted goods but later on they became a core part of the local lord's army. As battles, wars and the larger size of armies became more complex, they were vigorously trained so they could hold their ground against the oncoming enemy forces. Foot soldiers were mostly armed with spears but some did carry swords/katanas and others were used to operate war machinery, as well as being equipped with varying bows. Foot soldiers generally had light armor, consisting of leather pads sown together or a mixture between leather and iron/copper armors. This made them more agile on the battlefield but at times vulnerable against their opponents. In later periods foot soldiers were given firearms as well."
 japanese_samuraiDESCR: "Samurai were the noblemen of the time in Japan. Samurai meant 'to serve'. They were well educated, and were extremely well trained in fighting. They combined their fighting with arts and literature as past times. The Samurai were governed by a codex which was called Bushido meaning 'Way of the Warrior'. If their lord died or lost a war, they would be required to commit Seppuku (self assisted suicide) as part of the Bushido Code. The Samurai were expected to do the same thing and follow their master into the next life. The Samurai was a feared opponent on the battlefield due to them being highly trained in the fighting arts. They could wield a katana with great skill or use the yumi (Japanese longbow) either mounted or on foot."
 large_cast_bronze_mortarDESCR: "The largest cannons of the time were so enormous in size that they required hundreds of men and oxen to move them. They had an immense destruction power but could only fire a limited amount of times during the day due to the difficulties in loading and aiming these beasts."
 large_cast_iron_bombardDESCR: "A larger version of the standard Bombard. This piece of early European siege artillery was designed for launching heavy objects at enemy defenses. A notable example of a Large Bombard is Mons Meg, which was sent as a gift by Philip III of Burgundy to King James II of Scotland in 1453. Although they were devastating weapons, the larger Bombards took a long time to cool down after each firing, meaning they were of limited usefulness on the battlefield and remained largely for use during sieges."
 leather_cannonDESCR: "The Leather Cannon was first used by the armies of King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden during the third Polish-Swedish War. European artillery at this time was too large and heavy to be mobile on a battlefield, and was only really used during sieges. The introduction of a lighter, mobile cannon enabled the Swedes to maneuver their artillery to meet the movements of the enemy and gave them a distinct tactical advantage over their foes. Unfortunately the leather cannon used by the Swedes had a particular weakness which made it highly impractical. Consisting of a narrow copper tube covered in leather strapping and rope, its wrapping caused the cannon to overheat dangerously during continuous use. Nevertheless the Leather Cannon marked the beginning of the development of light field artillery and the concept of taking heavy firepower to the enemy."

 mamluk_cavalry_chargeDESCR: "Non-Muslim, slave warriors captured as children and trained to fight for their Islamic masters made up an essential portion of the military system of the Islamic world. Cavalry tactics and horsemanship became an integral part of their training later on, as they became followers of the Islamic beliefs."

 maya_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "The forest musketeer remained faithful to the tactics that served him during the pre-gunpowder age. The balance between attack and defense remained, but now the introduction of gunpowder weapons by the Europeans just made them more deadly."
 maya_tribal_warfareDESCR: "The forests and jungles of Central America was the home to the Mayan civilization. The terrain was not as open as further north giving more advantages to the defender. Here military units evolved that were suitable on both the attack and defense, although specializing in neither."

 muscovite_caracolleDESCR: "With the discovery that a tightly formed infantry could withstand cavalry shock action, and that the use of gunpowder weapons would inflict a fearful toll on the attacker, new cavalry tactics were required. One of the first of these was the Caracole (or spiral) where cavalry would use fire to disrupt infantry formations before attempting a charge. Developed in the West in the 16th century it quickly spread eastwards."
 muscovite_cossackDESCR: "Cossack cavalry steadily evolved as time progressed. Rather than being a shock cavalry force like the new heavier Hussars they specialized in skirmishing and would use pistols to disorganize the enemy."
 muscovite_musketeerDESCR: "With the large scale use of gunpowder weapons on the Eastern European battlefields new units began to be developed to take advantage of these.

 peruvian_guerilla_warfareDESCR: "The South American Guerrilla is a tough opponent. Although they do not do a lot of damage to the opposition, it can take a long time to wear down these units."
 polish_hussarDESCR: "The original Hussar was a light cavalry unit designed primarily for skirmishing. However, the battlefield demanded that units be better armored and heavier. Thus the Hussar evolved leading eventually to the famous Winged Hussars."
 polish_musketeerDESCR: "With the growing spread of gunpowder weapons, soon the question of what musket armed infantry should do on the battlefield was raised. In Poland, there developed a school of thought that musketeers should be used as a defensive weapon to support cavalry."
 polish_tercioDESCR: "Although the tercio came to dominate European battlefields it was initially too slow to be of use on the more open, cavalry dominated battlefields of Eastern Europe. However as the pike component of the tercio fell, giving it more firepower, it became more useful on the eastern battlefields."
 polish_winged_hussarDESCR: "In medieval times, mounted knights had dominated the medieval battlefield but afterwards were replaced by musketeers and pikemen. In the 17th century, cavalry forces were still used for a surprise effect in battles, but had often little chance against disciplined pikemen. Therefore, cavalry forces were little used in Western Europe. In Eastern Europe with its vast steppes, cavalry remained very important. The winged Hussars played a key role there. The Polish developed an excellent curved saber (the 'palasz'), selected horses specially for their speed and endurance and they carried lances with them, of six meters, that could pierce a pikemen's armor. The winged Hussars became a heavily armored cavalry that fought countless victorious actions against a variety of enemies. They played a key role in John Sobieski's legendary lifting of the Turkish siege of Vienna in 1683. John Sobieski sent four Hussar cavalry groups in a furious charge that broke the Turkish battle line, scattering them in confusion. This victory by the winged Polish Hussars saw John Sobieski hailed as the 'savior of Vienna'."
 prussian_uhlanDESCR: "The first Uhlans were created in the early 18th Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more the Heavily Armored Cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on in the 18th Century they became an essential part of the military's structure due to their light armor making them fast and agile on the battlefield and for their high shock value against their enemies, which in some cases turned the tide in Battles. The Uhlans were a good alternative to large Infantry Armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller Nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 prussian_drillDESCR: "Drilled Soldiers were soldiers that had been vigorously trained, so that they would know exactly what to do in a battle situation. They were also less likely to break ranks whilst fighting against the enemy. An example would be the Prussian Drilled Soldiers. They were among the world's best trained and equipped soldiers at the time. They were very disciplined and well trained for nearly any situation. So good was their reputation that the American Colonies had asked for Prussian drill instructors to be sent to train the colonists so they could fight against the British."
 pueblo_ambushDESCR: "In the broken terrain in the foothills of the Rockies, new tactics built around ambush began to develop. These units did not have the staying power of the mountain infantry but they did hurt the enemies' morale with their ambush tactics."
 qizilbash_cavalryDESCR: "Cavalry units, armed with spear, sword or bow easily recognized by their red and gold striped headgear, worn to express their devotion to the Twelver division of Shia Islam."
 reformed_asian_cavalryDESCR: "Westernized Asian cavalry more adapted to Western tactics and strategies."
 reformed_asian_musketeerDESCR: "Westernized Asian infantry equipped with muskets and more adapted to Western tactics and strategies."

 royal_mortarDESCR: "During the 18th century the use of artillery on the battlefield became more widespread. The troops were now able to move their field guns with much more ease and speed."
 russian_cossackDESCR: "Cossacks remained an integral part of Eastern European armies. Although neither as disciplined nor as effective in the charge as the heavy cavalry. These light units specialized in raiding and sniping to disrupt their opponents."
 russian_cuirassierDESCR: "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 russian_massDESCR: "Mass Infantry tactics were a departure from the linear tactics that had been dominant for so long. These units can be summed up in two of the maxims of the famous Russian general Suvorov 'train hard, fight easy' and 'The bullet is a fool, the bayonet is a fine chap'. They were highly drilled shock infantry who favored the mass charge over musket fire."
 russian_green_coatDESCR: "As more ideas were imported from Western Europe, the Eastern infantry man became much more like his Western European counterpart. The Green Coat infantry had its origins in Russia and its western training methods and equipment gave their units with more staying power in combat than ever before. It also represented a shift from the Petrine defense tactics to a more offensive unit."
 russian_lancerDESCR: "The Hussars of Eastern Europe had long been equipped with a lance along with other equipment. The lance was a power weapon in the attack, allowing a trooper to reach his enemy before the enemy could reach him, however once the enemy managed to get passed the lance the lancer was vulnerable. Lance equipped cavalry were very strong in the attack but weak defensively."
 russian_petrineDESCR: "Petrine Infantry have their roots in the defeat of the Russian Armies at the battle of Narva during the Great Northern War. The army had been decisively routed by the better trained, but numerically inferior, Swedish Army and the army needed new tactics if it was to succeed. Trained with iron discipline, the Petrine Infantry excelled in defense. Their tactics were built around wearing down the enemys' ability to fight through sheer staying power."
 saxon_infantryDESCR: "August the Strong, Elector of Saxony, was not just famous for siring more bastards than any other European Monarch, he was also King of Poland. During his reign he brought more offensive infantry tactics to the Polish military, and the units became known as Saxon Infantry."
 scottish_highlanderDESCR: "The Highland Infantry divisions which make up such a recognizable force in many of today's Commonwealth armies have their roots in the semi-feudal clan system of north and west Scotland. Scottish Highlanders were lightly armored clansmen, often equipped with the traditional Scottish basket-hilted sword, the claymore, as well as small knives, known as dirks. Later Highland soldiers also carried pistols. They were feared for the ferocity of their attack, particularly the famous Highland Charge, used to smash through enemy lines. Following the Jacobite rebellions, the Scottish Highlanders were gradually assimilated into the British Army. The first such Highland troops were the Black Watch, or 42nd Highland Regiment of Foot, who fought valiantly at Fontenoy during the War of Austrian Succession. The Highland Regiments subsequently became a feared fighting force, noted in particular for bravery and a refusal to surrender."
 shaybaniDESCR: "A cavalry unit most often relying on indirect military tactics, harassing and raiding its enemies."
 slavic_stradiotiDESCR: "The Stratioti developed in the Albanian-Greek areas of the Balkan. With little or no armor, they were armed with sabers, lances and maces. This light cavalry was excellent for screening, reconnaissance and for raiding into disarrayed or fleeing enemies. With the fall or Byzantium many sought refuge in the west, and the Venetian Stratioti cavalry of the late 15th century is believed by some to have introduced modern light cavalry tactics to the west."
 small_cast_iron_bombardDESCR: "An early form of European artillery used for both sieges and defense. The Bombard was a simple cannon able to hurl projectiles at enemy defenses. The missile of choice was often a metal ball or large stone, intended to cause damage to fortifications rather than enemy personnel. Even the smaller Bombards were heavy and difficult to move quickly during battle, limiting their use against infantry and cavalry formations."
 songhai_tribal_warfareDESCR: "A traditional West African tribal warrior armed with a spear and a characteristic shield excelling in defensive strategies."
 south_american_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "With the arrival of the Europeans to the Americas, gunpowder weapons came to be known by the local population. The advantages became apparent and it was only a matter of time before units appeared carrying muskets. The Defensive musketeer was the descendant of the mountain warriors, following a similar pattern of organization and focus but now armed with a musket. This unit is strongest in defense, but the new gunpowder weapons give it extra punch in attack."
 south_american_spearmenDESCR: "The basic unit of armies of South Americas. They were usually a peasant levy led by aristocratic officers and armed with spear and shield. This unit formed the backbone of the armies of states like the Inca Empire."
 south_american_warfareDESCR: "The high mountains of the Andes created an environment which was far superior for defense rather than attack. There was a gradual evolution were infantry began to specialize in defense and staying power over attack."
 spanish_tercioDESCR: "Tercio infantry was developed principally by the brilliant general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (El Gran Capitán), during the Italian Wars. It was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Tercio formations, with their disciplined and spirited professional soldiers, were famed on the European battlefield for their nearly invincible manner in combat during the 16th and 17th centuries. Their domination of the European battlefields came to a definite end with the Spanish defeat by the French at the battle of Rocroi in 1643. A new fighting system, promoted by Gustavus Adolphus, would take over from then on."
 swedish_arme_blancheDESCR: "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock, and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, the arme blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 swedish_carolineDESCR: "The military reforms of the Swedish king Charles XI created a new force of infantry, specializing in the attack. Devastating volleys of musket rounds would be the prelude to a mass charge."
 swedish_gallopDESCR: "The pistol armed Caracole Cavalry came to dominate European cavalry tactics in Eastern Europe, although the traditional shock action cavalry style of the Hussars was still in use. Armies trained in the Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed a different kind of unit, the Swedish Gallop Cavalry. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the Thirty Years' War, forcing the Imperial Caracole cavalry to adapt very quickly."
 swedish_gustavianDESCR: "In the early 17th century the musket had a loading time that was still very slow and musket fire needed to be concentrated in volleys to be destructive, as the weapons were very inaccurate and misfires were common. Such a slow reloading time meant that the unit would be very vulnerable if all the guns were fired simultaneously. Since the days of Maurice of Nassau this problem was overcome by arranging the unit in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. Gustavus Adolphus, the great Swedish king, significantly improved this Maurician infantry tactic. He trained his troops so well that he was able to reduce the number of ranks to only three (one kneeling, the second crouching and, the third standing) and yet still maintain continuous fire."
 swiss_landsknechtenDESCR: "Landsknechten were a type of infantry first created in the early 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire. They were mostly armed with a long spear or pike. George von Frundsberg is considered to be the creator of the Landsknechten. The Landsknechten fought mostly in a square type formation called the Pike Square. They were also famous for the elaborate clothing they wore on the battlefield."
 swivel_cannonDESCR: "A highly maneuverable and portable cannon. The Swivel gun was rather small and designed primarily for short range warfare."
 tartar_cossackDESCR: "The Cossack continued to evolve as a unit. The use of new weapons and tactics gave the units greater staying power in fire combat and more shock power."
 threedeckerDESCR: "A large battleship equipped with three gun decks, usually holding more than a 100 cannons."
 tofongchis_musketeerDESCR: "Despite initial reluctance, muskets gradually became more commonly accepted during the late 16th century. The advantage of firearms had become undeniable and muskets slowly found their way into the Muslim infantry forces."
 topchis_artilleryDESCR: "Muslim cavalry unit armed with a matchlock musket."
 twodeckerDESCR: "A two-decked battleship normally equipped with 60 to 90 guns."
 wargalleonDESCR: "The war galleon was a large galleon outfitted for war. It was larger and more heavily armed than the regular galleons, and served as protecting escorts to galleon fleets. The Spanish treasure fleets were made out of galleons and war galleons."
 westernized_adalDESCR: "East African warriors. Somewhat influenced by Western military defense tactics."
 westernized_aztecDESCR: "With the introduction of western training methods and new equipment, the hill warrior became a much more effective fighting man. The new training methods gave the unit much more cohesion in combat, while the new equipment improved the unit's abilities in both attack and defense. The hill warrior remained, however, a mainly defensive unit."
 westernized_bantuDESCR: "South African warriors influenced by Western military offense tactics and strategies."
 westernized_ethiopianDESCR: "North African warriors influenced by Western military defense tactics and strategies."

 westernized_niger_kongoleseDESCR: "Central African warriors influenced by Western military defense and offense tactics."
 westernized_south_americanDESCR: "The Westernized South American infantry were the successors of the mountain warriors of earlier eras. Western training and equipment has improved these units in all departments, but their focus remains defensive."
 westernized_zapotecDESCR: "The new military tactics of Europe were slowly spreading across the Americas. The new training methods strengthened the cohesion of the plains warrior, while the new equipment increased the effectiveness of the unit in all areas of combat."
 western_longbowDESCR: "The longbow was a missile weapon mostly used by infantry from England and Wales from the 14th to the 16th century. The weapon was very accurate and had a long range and was powerful enough to penetrate chain-mail armor. The English used this weapon with great success in the Hundred Years War against France, never more so than at the battles of Crécy and Agincourt. With the development of gunpowder, the longbow became obsolete. This was not because it was less powerful than the early muskets but because to become a good longbow-man, you had to train for many years, while training people to use fire-arms was much easier."
 western_medieval_infantryDESCR: "The basic soldier of Western European armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating."
 western_medieval_knightsDESCR: "The medieval Knight originated in the Frankish kingdoms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Western Europe and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which Knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 western_men_at_armsDESCR: "The Man at Arms was a professional soldier in Western European armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. During the Hundred Years War, Men at Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants at Arms."
 zapotec_gunpowder_warfareDESCR: "Even the plains warrior with his emphasis on bravery in attack, could not ignore the benefits of the musket brought from Europe. The new offensive musketeers still retained their attack emphasis, but the gunpowder weapons gave them additional firepower."
 zapotec_plains_warfareDESCR: "The plains warrior was the ultimate offensive unit in the Americas, but even they were not immune to progress. New weapons and tactics allowed the units to improve their offensive capability, while new training methods helped these warriors to maintain morale in combat."
 zapotec_tribal_warfareDESCR: "The area of the Zapotec empire created conditions highly suitable for offensive warfare. Here military units were developed that specialized in attack and used tactics designed to undermine the morale of their opponents."
 zaporoghian_cossackDESCR: "The Cossacks community originally grew up on the steppe boundary between Muscovy and Poland on one side and the Tatars on the other. In this savage environment of constant raiding, military communities of horsemen developed. They soon became in demand as hardy, if undisciplined, horsemen."
 zulu_chest_and_hornsDESCR: "An African military strategy developed by the African chief Shaka during the 18th century. The warriors would surround their enemy by positioning smaller groups of warriors on the left and right flank, representing the horns of a buffalo, and a larger group would be positioned in the middle, representing the chest."
