Nonetheless, we still aren't a proper country but an alliance or confederation of cantons with a coordinated military policy to protect our privileges. This decentralized model helps to keep our realm responsive and stable."

From the Swiss Guard who protect His Holiness in Rome to the Swiss mercenaries serving as auxiliaries and bodyguards in most of the courts of Christendom, Swiss mercenaries have proven legendary in their ability. Perhaps our native sons will give us a discount for working in our courts?"
 alpine_defensiveness: "Alpine Defensiveness"
 alpine_defensiveness_desc: "Throughout the late 13th and 14th centuries, we have been constantly repelling Habsburg (and, often, by extension, Imperial) incursions into our lands. Our mighty soldiers have played a major role in that, but the hardy, difficult terrain of our mountainous home has made invasion equally difficult."

 oasis_of_peace_and_prosperity_desc: "Even as the most gruesome of wars rages, there's usually little call to bring Switzerland in: after all, both sides need their Swiss mercenaries, and neither wants to be cut off. Perhaps if peace is prosperity, we should focus more on peace."
 swiss_tolerance: "Swiss Tolerance"
 swiss_tolerance_desc: "The Reformation threatens to tear our land apart. Some provinces join the Protestant movement, others Reform, and still others remain Catholic. Our land is ravaged by violence and confusion. Why must we kill each other over transubstantiation and predestination when we could turn our mountain home into a realm united once more?"
 haven_for_refugees: "Haven for Refugees"
 haven_for_refugees_desc: "Other countries shed political malcontents and authors with texts critical of their governments banned abroad. Some of these figures are quite interesting, and what harm would it do us to let them criticize their homelands from the safety of their new Alpine refuge? We will establish a tradition of Switzerland as the land where exiles can speak their mind freely."
 clockwork: "Clockwork"
 clockwork_desc: "Some fools think that clockwork is for clocks alone. When one witnesses the power of rotating gears ticking away, it's obvious that clockwork can do just about anything one wants it to do: maybe the Creator of the Universe himself wound up existence like a clock and let the gears spin on their own, ticking away the centuries. Be that as it may, Swiss clockmakers are the greatest masters of the art of clockwork in existence, barring God Himself of course."

The shrines to the Prophet and his Companions lay a mockery to the wise words of Abu Bakr.  Those who worship at these shrines are guilty of shirk, of exalting Man to the level of praise only Allah is due.

Piracy may be a vile sin in peacetime, but in times of war it's known as 'privateering' and that's surely another thing altogether, right?"

Those guns allow us to conquer more rival tribes and gain even more captives to sell to the Europeans to give us the funds to buy even more guns!  Some have said that the triangle trade is immoral, but they'll change their tune when they see our new muskets and how many more slaves we can capture with them and how many more muskets we can purchase with the proceeds."

Let's take steps to keep the Europeans satisfied with our supply of foreign captives to keep our own people safe from the horrors of slavery.  If we keep conducting these slave raids on the other tribes of Africa, it will keep our own people safe and bring in the revenue to keep our kingdom strong and our own people out of the chains."

 restore_malian_suzerainity_desc: "The Mali Empire has always been a decentralized affair, a collection of towns pledging loyalty to a Mansa with the Mansa's main duties to protect the routes between them and to defend them against bandits, raiders, and invaders.  Some of our vassals have sensed blood in the water and used our period of weakness in the early 15th century to end all pretense of vassaldom.  We must first remind them of the Mansa's rightful authority if we want our Empire to regain its former glory."

Unlike when he tried it, though, this time the Mansa will stay home."

 west_african_slave_trade_desc: "Even before our Empire existed, the great Wagadou, the Ghanan Empire that preceded us, sold slaves across the desert to the Arabs, and we have followed suit all these years, supplying the Arab world with a vast amount of slaves.  Now the Europeans clamor for a yet greater number of slaves to work in their holdings in the so-called New World.  We've had little report, but the amount of slaves they demand is truly stunning and they keep coming back, sometimes even raiding our shores and abducting our subjects.  The time has come to impose order on the slave trade and restrict the Europeans to select commercial ports where they will purchase, not steal, slaves."

The treacherous Aragonese, citing their marriage into the Hohenstaufen line, stole Sicily from us in 1282 and recently finished their violation of Papal will by usurping the title 'King of Naples' in 1442 away from our Good King René. The legacy of Charles of Anjou has fallen far, but we remember the vast holdings of our forefathers and their claims stretching all the way to Albania and Jerusalem."
 revive_house_of_anjou: "Revive House of Anjou"
 revive_house_of_anjou_desc: "The senior line of the House of Anjou went extinct in 1435 when Queen Joanna II of Naples passed away. Long live our junior line, the House of Valois-Anjou, fusion of the two greatest houses of France!  Through the fusion of two dynasties, the royal blood of Hugh Capet flows twice over. With a little work and planning, the devious throne-snatching of our Angevin forebears and the military valor of our Valois ancestors can unite to make the House of Valois-Anjou greater than either."
 composite_monarchy: "Composite Monarchy"
 composite_monarchy_desc: "Composite monarchy is a technical term for a kingdom that contains different pieces that are governed by their own legal codes and traditions but are nonetheless united under one crown.  Can there be a better description for the Angevin realms? Once upon a time our family had to govern lands from Anjou to Albania. Today, our reach might be somewhat smaller, but the duties of a Duke of Lorraine, a Duke of Bar, a Duke of Anjou, and a Count of Provence are considerably different even when all those titles are held by the same man. By our flexibility in running vastly different realms to one common goal, we placate our subjects and create a whole that is far greater than the sum total of its parts."

 toulon_dockyard_desc: "Our land is a natural Mediterranean port. The ancient Greeks realized the value of Marseilles when they settled it under the name Massilia at the dawn of memory. While Marseilles can remain the great commercial hub, Toulon would make a perfect place for a dockyard, naval armory, and staging ground for a fleet for our great country."
 provencal_quilting: "Provençal Quilting"
 provencal_quilting_desc: "One of the things that distinguishes our tongue from French is the use of 'oc' instead of 'oui' for yes. This can be observed at any hour of the day by people shouting 'Oc! Oc!' when presented with the chance to own boutis, stuffed wholecloth quilts. These distinctive pieces of Provence's heritage can be found in any place in Europe and their quality leaves foreigners swooning. Much like the Angevin holdings have always been a quilt of different peoples and heritages yet still one distinctive whole, the boutis is a glorious metaphor for our beautiful country."

 maritime_state_desc: "From the sea our Italian forefathers came to rule this land and from the sea our power comes even today. The duchy of Naxos - spread over most of the Cyclades, has always been a country looking at seas and their unyielding waves. If we are to remain strong and united the sea is where our future lies." 
 naxos_rules_the_waves: "Naxos Rules The Waves"  
 naxos_rules_the_waves_desc: "For many, a strong navy is a matter of prestige. For us, a strong navy is a vital matter of our very survival. With fiefs spread across dozens of islands the only way to maintain communication between parts of our domain is via the sea." 
 archipelago_of_opportunities: "Archipelago Of Opportunities" 
 archipelago_of_opportunities_desc: "Waters around our islands have always been treacherous for sailors and ships, particularly those carrying rich goods. A lightening fast attack by galleys manned by highly experienced men who spent their entire life in these waters would end with them disappearing faster than their prey would realize what had happened."

 archipelago_feudalism: "Archipelago Feudalism" 
 archipelago_feudalism_desc: "When we first arrived to these lands there was a rather unique meeting of civilizations: the Byzantine pronoia system of administration met head-on with Western European concept of feudalism. Something strange and beautiful happened at that point: it all mixed and matched together, creating a unique blend of Eastern and Western traditions, a system that works perfectly for both Greeks and Latins." 
 latin_roots: "Latin Roots"

 naxian_ambitions_desc: "Even though the Latin Empire - home of our old feudal overlords - is gone, the Latin legacy of crusaders still lives on through us.

 ge_home_of_fisherfolk: "Home of the Fisherfolk"
 ge_home_of_fisherfolk_desc: "Although our lands are dominated by never-ending jungles and low hills, even they must bow before the mightiest force of nature, water. Rivers carve our landscape, not only connecting our distant communities but also providing our people with water and fish. For generations we have lived off these waters and with great pride we claim that when it comes to fishing we are second to none." 
 yam_growers: "Yam Growers" 
 yam_growers_desc: "Even though our people have always been mostly hunter gatherers, yam is one exception to that rule. A common vegetable, native to rain forests of South America and fairly easy to grow, yam is the reserve food our people grow to always have something to fall back on."  
 ge_mithology: "Land of Mythology" 
 ge_mithology_desc: "The mythology of our people is more than just storytelling, it is a way of life in and of itself. Countless stories about good and evil, heroes, warriors and wise people from the past but also animals, such as the jaguar, the most sacred of all, are passed down from one generation to the next."  
 ge_jaguar_warriors: "The Way of the Jaguar" 
 ge_jaguar_warriors_desc: "The Jaguar has always been the most sacred animal for our people. Elusive, smart, powerful and awe-inspiring, it is the embodiment of all the values from our mythology. A supreme example for our warriors to emulate.\nNever be seen, unless you want to be, never be afraid, because in the jungle nights, you are the most dangerous thing out there. When you attack, strike so fast that your prey never knows what hit them, and finally, once it's done, disappear into the endless depth of jungle.\nThat is the way of the jaguar."
 ge_establish_trade: "Open Trade Routes" 
 ge_establish_trade_desc: "For as long as we can remember our people have lived in scattered communities along the banks of countless jungle rivers. Many of these small fishing villages and communities have never had any contact with each other. This is now changing. Our people are starting to travel by rivers and trade with their distant cousins and relatives. Together with this trade our ideas and mythology can spread."

 ge_unite_the_tribes_desc: "Rumors and whispers come along the rivers. Stories of a white man coming to our shores from across the Endless Seas and a distant land. Entire villages on top of great wooden boats full of men with fire sticks. Wherever they come, death soon follows. If we are to survive this challenge, unlike any other ever encountered by our people, we must gather all our villages and communities and prepare to act as one."

 pom_idea_1_desc: "Being a busy network of lucrative trade, the Baltic Sea, and thus the Northern German coast has always been a very good place for piracy. So much so that even rulers of these small countries often participated, more or less openly. There is nothing like stealing lots of gold from one of your rivals." 
 pom_idea_2: "Pomeranian Merchants" 
 pom_idea_2_desc: "The Pomeranians have a long tradition of sailing across the Baltic Sea in search of safe havens for their ships and merchandise. Many foreigners have heard of us - from Novgorod to Constantinople."

 kaz_idea_3: "Warrior Society"

 kaz_idea_4: "Legacy of the Great Horde" 
 kaz_idea_4_desc: "Oral tradition is the basis of our society. A long time ago, our elders say, a young boy rose from nothing to become the Khan of Khans and conquered the whole world in the mere blink of a lifetime. The world still trembles from his name and it shall learn to fear the steppes once again." 
 kaz_idea_5: "Steppe Warfare" 
 kaz_idea_5_desc: "Since the dawn of time, when our forefathers knew nothing of the one God and his Prophet, steppe warfare revolved around one thing: unity of a horse and a man. In the steppe they become one, a single life, and a single fighting force. No army has ever managed to beat the steppe hit and run tactics, even the mighty Iskender fell before us."

The sense of having the first national church in the world brings us immense pride in our nation. Our religious faith has helped us maintain our identity and hope, especially with thanks to the Saint Mesrop Mashdots and his Armenian alphabet, which revolutionized the fate of our people. It was a fundamental step in strengthening Armenian statehood and identity."

 melikdom_organization: "Melikdom Organization"
 melikdom_organization_desc: "As one of the few bastions of an independent Armenian state, Armenia was governed by feudal suzerains called meliks, as the old nakharar system collapsed. The relationship between meliks and their subordinates was that of a military commanding officer and junior officer, and not of feudal lord and a serf. Peasants were often allowed to own land, were free and owned property."
 sygnakhs: "Sygnakhs"
 sygnakhs_desc: "Sygnakhs are military structures in Armenia for recruiting organizations, fortification systems, signal beacons and logistical support. Usually each melik would have his own sygnakh, but larger sygnakhs are shared by different meliks. Establishing such sygnakhs allows us to rally our troops more effectively."
 nakharar_titles: "Nakharar Titles"
 nakharar_titles_desc: "Weakened by numerous invasions and the legal reforms of kings, the nakharar structure remained virtually unchanged for many centuries and was finally eliminated during the Mongol invasions in the thirteenth century. Restoring feudal despotism is out of the question, but reviving the ancient title of our noblemen would encourage national pride."
 end_of_armenian_diaspora: "End of Armenian Diaspora"
 end_of_armenian_diaspora_desc: "Our people have been scattered far and wide, without a home to return to. The revival of the Armenian nation should encourage much of our overseas compatriots to return to their motherland!"

 bardic_literature_desc: "By reviving our ancient poetic traditions, we can stand to last the test of time. The best wars are not won often with the sword, but with poetry and prose as well. A revival in the bardic traditions would also allow us to revive the eisteddfod, a grand gathering to which were invited poets and musicians from all over the country. The winner of the yearly eisteddfod is granted a seat in the lord's council. Our poets have kept alive the Welsh spirit and their songs shall inspire us."
 cyfraith_hywel: "Cyfraith Hywel"
 cyfraith_hywel_desc: "There are calls to revive the traditional Welsh law of Hywel the Good and the old cantrefi system for governing Wales, each of which was divided into several commotes. These were of particular importance in the administration of the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the uchelwyr, nobles, the main landowners of the cantref."
 unbennaeth_prydain: "Unbennaeth Prydain"
 unbennaeth_prydain_desc: "'The Monarchy of Britain' was an Old Welsh poem that served as a national anthem for the many medieval Welsh kingdoms. Although the specific composition is now lost, it presumably recounted the exploits of the former kings of the Britons. Reviving a new form of this composition would stoke national pride."
 economic_revival: "Economic Revival"
 economic_revival_desc: "Wales had several problems in becoming an economic power. It was restricted by its peripheral location, predominantly upland topography, poor communications and sparse population. By encouraging the development of trading and ports, as well as mining rich mineral deposits, we can spur new advances not only in economy, but technology as well."
 prifysgolion_cymru: "Prifysgolion Cymru"

 west_african_idea_4: "Ancestors and Crescent"
 west_african_idea_4_desc: "From the north, strangers preaching foreign and merchants worshipers of those faith have come. To the south, followers of the ancient ways of our people still remain. We must strive to establish balance between these groups, and ensure that both find themselves represented in the ways of our state."
 west_african_idea_5: "Royal Stables"

 warrior_tribes_desc: "Our people are first and foremost warriors. We didn't always live in these lands that we now inhabit. We came from a place long forgotten to meet the previous occupants of these valleys. These weak tribes are no more but the Tupi still stand. Stronger than ever and still looking over distant horizons, our warriors fear nothing and prize a glorious death in combat above all else."

 splash_and_burn_desc: "Although our people are renown warriors of the jungles, when we had first arrived to these lands we brought with us another invention, one that had nothing to do with military matters whatsoever and yet one that has allowed us to gain dominion over all these lands, defeating and displacing their previous occupants: Agriculture. While our enemies live mostly as hunters and gatherers, always on the move from one place to another, our people lead a sedentary life, growing crops that feed many hundreds more. Slash and burn is a method of shifting agricultural cultivation that has allowed our people to clear huge swaths of land to open them up for planting." 
 cultivate_the_land: "Cultivate The Land" 
 cultivate_the_land_desc: "The Jungle is a harsh environment to live in, especially if your people wish to grow their food and not live off the land. Clearing jungles is therefore one of the most important tasks for our society if it is to survive and prosper.

 head_hunters: "Head Hunters" 
 head_hunters_desc: "Conquering land from weaker peoples is the very essence of our tribe. This lifestyle has created a unique warrior code according to which capturing and not killing the enemy is the highest form of bravery and valor. This has made our people famous for their mastery of capturing people alive, a skill that may be useful to many of those white newcomers that have landed on our shores." 
 wall_builders: "Wall Builders"

Over the years many have tried to tame it by raising strong bridges of wood or stone at Decize, Nevers or La Charité, yet they have always had to be rebuilt after the next strong flood. While this is the source of many of the region's sorrows it has taught us to deal with the forces of nature, a lessen any invader would have to pay for more dearly."

 french_enlightenment_desc: "French culture and French language is the carrier of the ideas of the modern age.

As French becomes the language of all courts, books and plays our influence spreads worldwide with it."
 french_la_petite_nation: "La Petite Nation"
 french_la_petite_nation_desc: "The foreigners always speak of France as the country with one king. This well may be true but this does not mean in any way that the king is alone to undertake anything positive for our fellow Frenchmen. The French provinces have a life of their own, and be it under the royal authority or in a more autonomous way they are able to produce strong men and beautiful wives, great philosopher, artists and learned men. Paris matter little to us in day to day matters. We must stand up for our own people for we are the true Frenchmen and without us the French region would be both weaker and more bland."

Benzhuism has a pantheon of numerous deified ancestors, god-like heroes, and mighty nature gods. People pray to these gods for good harvests or health. Any attempt to ban or limit such a faith would be ridiculous as the practise of Benzhu worship can keep our society very stable.

 rzw_strict_gold_regulations_desc: "Agriculture and trade bring us what we need for our day to day living but the main export of our country remains the abundant gold which can be found all over the Zimbabwe plateau. While such riches are a blessing to our state this metal can also be quite dangerous unless it is kept under firm control. Our state must tightly regulate all trade and ownership of Gold in order to avoid the destructive influences of fortune seekers or greedy middle men."
 rzw_empowering_the_rozwi: "Empowering the Rozwi"
 rzw_empowering_the_rozwi_desc: "A powerful faction has begun to grow in our lands. Strong loyalty to their leader and dissatisfaction with their lot in life in the Zimbabwe plateau. The Rozwi, or 'destroyers', are disciplined fighters ready to unify the Shona peoples and create a new type of state. If we do not embrace them we may well find ourselves overrun against our will."
 rzw_hierarchical_tax_organization: "Hierarchical Tax Organization"
 rzw_hierarchical_tax_organization_desc: "The Mutapa entrusted each subordinate chief to bring his taxes to their capital. We cannot imagine a more inefficient custom. Let us instead create a consistent system of hierarchical tax collection where each person will pass the riches on upwards towards the state coffers in an organized and efficient way. The army must also at times work as an arm of the royal bureaucracy to ensure that none of our subjects forget what we are owed."
 rzw_discipline_and_traning: "Regular Training"
 rzw_discipline_and_traning_desc: "Discipline, preparation and training is what wins battles. With this in mind our commanders have successfully begun to pioneer elaborate new tactics and a new army organization. Let us make good use of these innovations by dividing our warriors into regiments and then let them train regularly with their bows, assegais, daggers and axes. Practice will also allow them to fight in formation without fear, defeating much more numerous enemies."
 rzw_mwari_cult: "Mwari Cult"
 rzw_mwari_cult_desc: "Our superstitious neighbors believe they are protected by natural deities or their own ancestors. We have on the other hand seen the greatness of Mwari, the one god who created the world from nothing. As he speaks the mountains tremble and our ruler is his oracle. Let us spread the cult of Mwari among all peoples so that all may can see the divine authority of our ruler."
 rzw_vashambadzi: "Vashambadzi"
 rzw_vashambadzi_desc: "The growing intracontinental trade, with goods flowing back and forth from the central parts of the Kongo river basin to the trade cities of Eastern Africa, The Great Lakes and the Zimbabwe highlands has greatly enriched the Vashambadzi, our native merchant community. Let us support this group over all others by baring Swahili traders as well as European fortune seekers from trading within our borders."
