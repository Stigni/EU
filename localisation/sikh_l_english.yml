 sikhism_flavor.1.d: "[Root.GetName] is situated on the border between adherents of Hinduism and Islam. In this area marked by religious tension and differences, a man named Nanak has started to preach that there is no Hindu or Muslim, but that the truth is with God, who is neither.\n\nAlthough his rejection of ancient customs has outraged devoted [Root.Religion.GetName] believers, Nanak's disregard for caste and creed has allowed his teachings to take root among the population. His disciples are known as Sikhs and are spreading this new faith rapidly throughout [Root.GetName]."
 sikhism_flavor.1.a: "We'll need to talk to this Nanak about the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith."

Guru Nanak's body is dead, but the spirit of the Guru lives on in his successor, Guru Angad.

 sikhism_flavor.4.a: "Our Guru is a servant of God and we serve our Guru."
 sikhism_flavor.5.t: "Guru Arjan"

To preserve the knowledge and hymns of past gurus, Arjan has begun to compile a volume known as the Adi Granth.

 sikhism_flavor.7.t: "Guru Har Rai"

 sikhism_flavor.8.t: "Guru Har Krishan"
 sikhism_flavor.8.d: "The body of Guru Har Rai passed on, leaving a very young successor to assume the mantle.

 sikhism_flavor.9.t: "Guru Tegh Bahadur"
 sikhism_flavor.9.d: "The young Guru Har Krishan has tragically passed away. After some confusion about who his successor might be, Tegh Bahadur has been chosen as the new Guru.

Despite his own rejection of rituals and ceremonial practices, he has taken on the task of safeguarding not only the religion of his own followers, but of Hindus who flee to our lands from persecution."
 sikhism_flavor.9.a: "Our Guru is the True King and the shield of the oppressed."
 sikhism_flavor.10.t: "Guru Gobind Singh"
 sikhism_flavor.10.d: "With the death of Tegh Bahadur, Sikhs have once again had to face hostility from their political and religious enemies. His son, Gobind Rai, is determined to unite the Sikhs and gather those who are willing to give their lives for their Guru. The coming decades will build up to the creation of the Khalsa, those initiated by the Guru's ceremonies into our faith, and Gobind Rai will be known to history as Guru Gobind Singh."

 sikhism_flavor.11.t: "Guru Granth Sahib"
 sikhism_flavor.11.d: "Guru Gobind Singh is gone, but has passed on the guruship to one who shall never die. The collection of sacred texts known as the Adi Granth, once created by Guru Arjan and built upon by gurus after him, was designated by Gobind Singh as the final successor who will guide the Sikhs: The Guru Granth Sahib. Henceforth, whatever questions Sikhs may have for the Guru shall be answered by the knowledge contained within it."

 sikhism_flavor.13.d: "A man who some call a guru has arrived in [Root.GetName]. He claims to have received a revelation, being called by Heaven to travel from his home to distant lands, spreading the message of the one true God.\n\nHis local disciples insist that this God is revealed through all religions, including [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName], and defends Nanak as simply revealing the truths in our own faith. However, there is no question that these teachings reject our rituals and traditions, making people stray from the true path of [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName]."
 sikhism_flavor.13.a: "As long as they pay taxes, they can believe what they want."
 sikhism_flavor.13.b: "Get this Nanak out of [Root.GetName]!"
