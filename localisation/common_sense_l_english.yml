 papacy_events.1.t: "The Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.1.d: "The famous mercenaries of Switzerland - the Swiss Guards - are disciplined, loyal and employ revolutionary battle tactics which has given them the reputation of being the most powerful troops in the world. $MONARCHTITLE$, consider a pact with Switzerland, to provide us with a constant corps of Swiss mercenaries to protect $COUNTRY$ against hostile troops."
 papacy_events.1.a: "Send a legate to Switzerland to ask for the Swiss Guard."
 papacy_events.1.b: "Do nothing."
 papacy_events.2.t: "Pope asks for Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.2.d: "Our soldiers seek fortunes abroad and that has led to our troops getting reputation of being the most disciplined, loyal and powerful troops who employ revolutionary battle tactics. Many wishes to hire our troops, even the Pope who wishes to enter a pact with us. He asks that we provide [From.GetName] with a constant corps of Swiss mercenaries. This will surely increase our prestige and give us other favors."
 papacy_events.2.a: "Send the guards to the Pope."
 papacy_events.2.b: "No, we need them more."
 papacy_events.3.t: "Switzerland sends Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.3.d: "The messenger from Switzerland has arrived, and announced that they agree to the pact. He adds; 'The Swiss see the sad situation of the Church of God, Mother of Christianity, and realize how grave and dangerous it is that any tyrant, avid for wealth, can assault with impunity, the common Mother of Christianity.'"
 papacy_events.3.a: "We are most grateful for this!"
 papacy_events.4.t: "No Swiss Guard"
 papacy_events.4.d: "Due to the excellence of the Swiss mercenaries and the high demand from other countries, Switzerland has rejected our pact and refuses to send any corps to our defense."
 papacy_events.4.a: "But... we need them!"
 papacy_events.5.t: "Passetto di Borgo"
 papacy_events.5.d: "Pope Nicholas III erected the passage Passetto di Borgo, which links the Vatican City with the Castel Sant'Angelo in 1277. Many Popes have used it as an escape route when in danger, and now it is the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s turn! Rome is lost, and the enemy has entered the palace to arrest the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 papacy_events.5.a: "Flee through the passage!"
 papacy_events.5.b: "Stay. We have nothing to fear."
 papacy_events.6.t: "Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.6.d: "The long tradition of appointing a nephew or other relative to the College of Cardinals is an easy way to make sure that family members are well cared for. Popes Gregory IX, Alexander IV, Adrian V, Gregory XI, Boniface IX, Innocent VII and Eugene IV have all promoted relatives to cardinals, especially nephews, thus the name Cardinal-Nephew. It is said that the first Cardinal-Nephew was Lotario, cousin of Pope Benedict VIII. The promotions of papal relatives to the College of Cardinals became common in the 13th century and now there's an opening for a Cardinal [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] should consider whether or not a relative of his should get the appointment. Of course, the ruler must be asked beforehand, and if they refuse we can do nothing."
 papacy_events.6.a: "No, this is a tradition we should end."
 papacy_events.6.b: "Let us ask him if our nephew may become the new Cardinal."
 papacy_events.7.t: "A Cardinal-Nephew from the Pope"
 papacy_events.7.d: "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Owner.Monarch.GetName] is asking us to appoint his Cardinal-Nephew to [Root.GetName] as Cardinal. It is a very common practice among Popes to elevate a relative, most often a nephew, to Cardinal. Benedict VIII's cousin Lotario was first one to be appointed Cardinal-Nephew in 1015."
 papacy_events.7.a: "Accept the Pope's Cardinal-Nephew."
 papacy_events.7.b: "Refuse."
 papacy_events.8.t: "Accepted Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.8.d: "[From.Owner.GetName] has accepted the nephew as the new Cardinal in [From.GetName]."
 papacy_events.8.a: "Perfect!"
 papacy_events.9.t: "Refused Cardinal-Nephew"
 papacy_events.9.d: "[From.Owner.GetName] has refused to appoint the nephew to Cardinal in [From.GetName]."
 papacy_events.9.a: "How disappointing."
 papacy_events.10.t: "Sack of Rome"
 papacy_events.10.d: "The recent battle has left the city of Rome in shambles, an event that will soon be known as the Sack of Rome. Mutinous troops of our enemy desired the sack and pillage of our rich city that for them appeared to be an easy target. The troops were joined by deserters and numerous bandits and their number soon greatly outnumbered ours. Our massive walls and strong artillery force at first seemed capable to repel the attackers, and when their commander was fatally wounded in the first assault we thought they would retreat, but no. Their restraint disappeared when their commander fell, and the soldiers captured the walls of Rome the same day. On the steps of St Peter's Basilica, our last few guards met a ghastly end, slaughtered before the pillage began. Destruction, looting and executions followed until, at last, the bandits, deserters, soldiers and looters began their long trek home with what valuables they managed to pilfer."
 papacy_events.10.a: "Hire more soldiers to ensure the Sack of Rome will never happen again."
 papacy_events.10.b: "Repair the damage done to the city, that is all we can do."
 papacy_events.11.t: "The Vatican Library"
 papacy_events.11.d: "It is not yet formally established, though our library contains a multitude of manuscripts, books, edifices and other written works. Right now the books are scattered in Rome, Avignon and elsewhere, but if we collect them in our capital and add to it, our great library could become one of the greatest since the Royal Library of Alexandria. The founding of the Vatican Library could re-establish $CAPITAL$ as a destination for scholarship."
 papacy_events.11.a: "Establish it, and focus on administrative works."
 papacy_events.11.b: "The focus should be on diplomatic works."
 papacy_events.11.c: "Fund a library about the military arts."
 papacy_events.11.e: "We will need to think more about this."
 papacy_events.12.t: "Sistine Chapel"
 papacy_events.12.d: "The Cappella Maggiore - the Greater Chapel - is used for masses that can be held in smaller, less public spaces than the Basilicas. The years have not been gentle to the once magnificent chapel that was decorated by Fra Angelico, its walls are leaning and it is in ruinous state. The chapel should be demolished, the structure is not safe enough for the many masses that are held there every year. A new, more magnificent building should take its place, and there are many famous artists that would be honored if they were asked to decorate the new Sistine Chapel."
 papacy_events.12.a: "Demolish the old and build the new on the same place."
 papacy_events.12.b: "Just stop using the old chapel, there are other buildings we can use."
 papacy_events.13.t: "Decorate the Sistine Chapel"
 papacy_events.13.d: "The old, decrepit Cappella Maggiore is no more - in its place the grand Sistine Chapels now stands. The Temple of Solomon and the Sistine Chapels are the same dimensions, as given in the Old Testament. The exterior is unadorned by decorative details, the building divided into three stories with a vaulted ceiling and six tall arched windows on the sides, two on either end. Although beautiful in its simplicity, the chapel's beauty could be enhanced by frescoes painted by the foremost artists of our time."
 papacy_events.13.a: "Hire Sandro Botticelli."
 papacy_events.13.b: "Hire Domenico Ghirlandaio."
 papacy_events.13.c: "Hire Pietro Perugino."
 papacy_events.13.e: "Hire Michelangelo."
 papacy_events.13.f: "Just find someone to decorate the chapel!"
 papacy_events.13.g: "Leave it as it is, we need not do it now."
 papacy_events.14.t: "Indulgences - to sell or not?"
 papacy_events.14.d: "Many countries have started to sell indulgences for money, so that the rich may save their souls and continue living in sin. This practice guides a lot of money to the coffers of the Church, and while some condemn it, others think it should be allowed."
 papacy_events.14.a: "We forbid this practice!"
 papacy_events.14.b: "Money makes the world go around..."
 papacy_events.15.t: "Simony Judged"
 papacy_events.15.d: "In the Acts of the Apostles 8:9-24, Simon Magus offered the two disciples Peter and John money if they empowered him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone he placed his hands on. This act, of selling spiritual things such as church offices and roles, is called Simony after this man and many a ruler has been swayed by the glimmer of gold to sell bishop seats. "
 papacy_events.15.a: "We will treat this as the crime it is!"
 papacy_events.15.b: "This is a practice we will allow."
 papacy_events.16.t: "Veneration of Relics - allow or disallow?"
 papacy_events.16.d: "Churches has always kept relics from saints, to venerate and in some cases use to heal the sick and infirm. This long practice has now been challenged, and some believe it to be idolatry, a heresy that should be banned. The selling of relics has made many a church rich, and if the Pope were to publicly announce his support of this practice, some of that money would find its way to our coffers."
 papacy_events.16.a: "Prevent the sale of relics!"
 papacy_events.16.b: "We will grow richer if we allow and practice this."
 papacy_events.17.t: "Galileo Galilei"
 papacy_events.17.d: "The notion that the Earth and the planets would revolve around the Sun is an idea Nicolaus Copernicus first wrote about in his book 'De revolutionibus orbium coelestium' in 1543 and now Galileo Galilei has promoted it again, in his book 'Sidereus Nuncius' - 'Starry Messenger'! His controversial championing of this has given him many enemies in the Catholic Church, and although we admit that he would be a most interesting debate opponent, maybe we should be cautious and just imprison him to stop his ideas to reach the public?"
 papacy_events.17.a: "Invite him to discuss theology."
 papacy_events.17.b: "He must be put to trial."
 papacy_events.18.t: "Sublimis Deus"
 papacy_events.18.d: "It is to our dismay that we have learnt that Catholic countries have enslaved the Indians of the West and the South to use them as a cheap work source. Granted that earlier Popes have allowed this, as they argued that these new people were not truly human and possessed no souls. The New Testament says that the gospel has been preached to all nations and since they do not believe in our God, perhaps they do not count. Humanity is divided into three race, Europeans, Asians, and Africans, one for each of the sons of Noah, and the Indians of the Americas do not fit among these divisions. Now that we know that these pagans can be converted, it is time to revision our old beliefs and acknowledge these as humans, with souls, who God has a purpose for."
 papacy_events.18.a: "Condemn it and make sure every Catholic knows that it is wrong."
 papacy_events.18.b: "Their purpose is slavery."
 papacy_events.19.t: "The Pope Condemns Slavery"
 papacy_events.19.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has issued a new papal bull, the Sublimis Deus, which forbids the enslavement of the Indians of the West and the South and all other people."
 papacy_events.19.a: "Accept the papal bull."
 papacy_events.19.b: "Refuse and continue the slavery of these people."
 papacy_events.20.t: "$COUNTRY$ Follows the Pope's Decree"
 papacy_events.20.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] will condemn slavery."
 papacy_events.20.a: "Excellent!"
 papacy_events.21.t: "$COUNTRY$ Disregards the Pope's Decree"
 papacy_events.21.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] refuses to condemn the slavery of the Indians of the West and South."
 papacy_events.21.a: "How can they not!?"
 papacy_events.22.t: "Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.22.d: "People in provinces suffering from famine, disease and unfortunate events claim that sorcery and witchcraft are behind their misery. Women, children and men have been accused of being witches, of worshipping the Devil and being a threat to Christendom. It has gone so far that people have lynched alleged witches without a proper trial!"
 papacy_events.22.a: "There are no such things as sorcery and witches!"
 papacy_events.22.b: "We will not interfere, not now."
 papacy_events.22.c: "Send a messenger to the Pope, to ask for advice."
 papacy_events.22.e: "Do nothing about it."
 papacy_events.23.t: "Pope Condemns Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.23.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has sent a messenger to discuss the recent witch hunts in our country. He strongly condemns the witch trials, especially the lynchings that have occured when suffering people have taken it into their own hands to punish alleged witches. 'There are no such things as witches and sorcery, only superstitions and the blame that suffering people wish to lay on innocent women, children and men'. We might not agree with this sentiment, but [From.Monarch.GetName] is the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]..."
 papacy_events.23.a: "Stop the witch hunts and trials!"
 papacy_events.23.b: "The witches are to blame for our suffering, this cannot stop!"
 papacy_events.24.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Stops the Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.24.tooltip: "No More Witch Trials!"
 papacy_events.24.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has stopped the witch hunts in $FROMCOUNTRY$ and proclaimed that sorcery and witchcraft are nothing more than silly superstitions."
 papacy_events.24.a: "That is wonderful!"
 papacy_events.24.b: "What? How dare [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] go against the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 papacy_events.25.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Allows Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.25.tooltip: "Witch trials for all!"
 papacy_events.25.d: "The suffering of [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]'s people has hardened [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart and the witch trials will continue in $FROMCOUNTRY$."
 papacy_events.25.a: "This is not what we decreed!"
 papacy_events.25.b: "Excellent!"
 papacy_events.26.t: "Witch Trials in $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 papacy_events.26.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] is asking the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] for advice about the recent witch hunts and trials. The people of $FROMCOUNTRY$ are blaming the famines, diseases and other unfortunate events on sorcery and witchcraft. The sufferings have led to women, children and men being accused of worshipping the Devil and being a threat to Christendom. Should they be banned, these witch hunts and trials, or should the people be allowed to hunt, pursue, lay blame and punish people that might be innocent or not of witchcraft?"
 papacy_events.26.a: "Condemn the witch hunts and trials!"
 papacy_events.26.b: "The people should be allowed to continue this practice."
 papacy_events.27.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle]: Condemn Witch Trials"
 papacy_events.27.d: "After asking [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] for advice on the whole witch situation, about whether or not we should continue with our witch hunts and trials, we waited long for the answer. It finally arrived, with the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] signature at the end of the official document. 'Cease with the witch hunts and trials immediately!'"
 papacy_events.27.a: "We obey."
 papacy_events.27.b: "We decline."
 papacy_events.28.t: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle]: Allow witch trials"
 papacy_events.28.d: "The message from the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] was very clear, sorcery and witchcraft should be pursued, the accused ones tried and the guilty ones punished for their sinful deeds. All who worship the Devil, attend witches' Sabbaths and threaten Christendom will burn in Hell!"
 papacy_events.28.a: "We understand, and we accept."
 papacy_events.28.b: "No, we refuse!"
 papacy_events.29.t: "The Rival's Pope"
 papacy_events.29.d: "The former Papal controller is a rival of our current, and there are plenty of decisions, papal bulls and decrees of the last [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that can be made undone. This would soil the former [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reputation and make him look incompetent, which would be looked upon with gratitude and approval from our current Papal controller."
 papacy_events.29.a: "Then we will erase his deeds."
 papacy_events.29.b: "Every Pope should be respected, even the bad ones." 
 papacy_events.30.t: "Rivalry between Popes"
 papacy_events.30.d: "The previous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] was controlled by one of our rivals, and if [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] were to erase the work he has done by dissolving decisions, cancel Papal bulls and dismissing decrees of his, then it would soil the reputation of both the previous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and our rival!"
 papacy_events.30.a: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] erased the former Pope's decisions!"
 papacy_events.30.b: "He did nothing!?"
 papacy_events.31.t: "Papal Rivalry"
 papacy_events.31.d: "The current Papal controller is pressuring [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] to undo decisions, papal bulls and decrees of the previous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] who we were Papal controller of. It would soil our and our [From.Monarch.GetTitle]'s reputation, making us both look incompetent!"
 papacy_events.31.a: "The bast... [From.Monarch.GetName] actually did it!"

 # Devotion Events
 devotion_events.1.t: "General Hospital"
 devotion_events.1.d: "A suggestion has been put forward to set up a general hospital, to create a place where the needy would be welcomed and assisted. The public health is very important, and to offer a free midwifery course and some establishments to combat disease would increase the well-being of everyone."
 devotion_events.1.a: "If this should improve the public health, then what are we waiting for? Do it!"
 devotion_events.1.b: "Prayer will solve all their problems, do not waste money on that!"
 devotion_events.2.t: "Fort Maintenance"
 devotion_events.2.d: "Our forts are the most important defense we have against intruders and enemies, but they are in great need of restoration. We would need to increase our taxes in order to fund this, and that will most certainly upset those who pay taxes."
 devotion_events.2.a: "We need this, ignore the rabble!"
 devotion_events.2.b: "Do what is possible with the money we already have."
 devotion_events.3.t: "Modernization of the Forts"
 devotion_events.3.d: "The forts no longer look as if they would crumble before our eyes, they are now sturdy enough to withstand most attacks to their walls. Their defenses, although now functional and impressive despite their age, are still lacking in comparison to other nation's forts. We would need to dig deep into the pockets of our taxpayers in order to be able to fund the upgrades and the modernization our forts sorely need."
 devotion_events.3.a: "It is for the greater good... who wants to be invaded?"
 devotion_events.3.b: "They are good enough as they are."
 devotion_events.4.t: "Too High Taxes"
 devotion_events.4.d: "It's hard to hear the citizens rage against the raised taxes from the high, high walls and inside the thick, thick towers of our restored forts, but we do hear them threatening revolt and rebellion unless we lower the taxes."
 devotion_events.4.a: "We hear, and we reluctantly oblige."
 devotion_events.4.b: "Say what? WE CANNOT HEAR YOU!"
 devotion_events.5.t: "Embellishment of Forts"
 devotion_events.5.d: "A gift of a stained-glass was placed in one of our forts, and the effect is exquisite. So exquisite, in fact, that we consider embellishing every fort we own with our sigil in stained-glass."
 devotion_events.5.a: "Vanity is a sin, even if it is for a fort!"
 devotion_events.5.b: "Just increase the taxes to pay for it."
 devotion_events.6.t: "The Quest for Religious Freedom"
 devotion_events.6.d: "A man known for his radical ideas about religious reforms is condemning the priests and the [Root.Religion.GetName] doctrines in his sermons. This has led to widespread complaints and demands for religious freedom from our not-so-loyal citizens."

 devotion_events.6.b: "Concede full religious freedom to the city."
 devotion_events.7.t: "False Beliefs"
 devotion_events.7.d: "One of [Root.Government.GetName]'s purposes is to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and protect it from heresy. It is a noble cause, but when heresy strikes in the very heart of our country it shames us. One of our provinces does not follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and as our cause is to spread the true faith we must deal with this or be forever shamed."
 devotion_events.7.a: "Send missionaries and increase efforts to convert the heretics."
 devotion_events.7.b: "Then we shall be ashamed."
 devotion_events.8.t: "Forgery of Documents"
 devotion_events.8.d: "It was a common defense against annexation and usurpation to forge documents, have them counterfeited or backdated to corroborate one's arguments during times of struggles for expansion of territory or privileges. Even now these questionable methods are used, and even we ponder if this practice should benefit us. Hopefully no one will detect the discrepancies..."
 devotion_events.8.a: "Forge those documents."

 devotion_events.8.ct: "The forgery might be discovered..."
 devotion_events.9.t: "Forged Documents"
 devotion_events.9.d: "Despite our best efforts in concealing the forgery, the counterfeit, the backdated documents, we were exposed. All we wanted to do was to protect [Root.Country.GetName] from those who would seek to annex and usurp our provinces."

 devotion_events.12.t: "The Merchant's Son"
 devotion_events.12.d: "A shrewd mind for negotiations and a talent for bargaining that must come from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] merchant parents have made burghers, free peasants and the nobles of [Root.Country.GetName] respect and fear [Root.Heir.GetName]. They will never attempt to fool [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in any kinds of bargains or negotiations when [Root.Heir.GetName] becomes [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 devotion_events.12.a: "Our heir might be a mere merchant's son, but [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has proven [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]self!"
 devotion_events.13.t: "The Talented Theologian"
 devotion_events.13.d: "Learned in the science of things divine, the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] is able to use various forms of analysis and argument to help understand, explain, defend or promote numerous religious topics. "
 devotion_events.13.a: "We knew from the beginning that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will rule [Root.Country.GetName] wisely."
 devotion_events.14.t: "The Local Preacher"
 devotion_events.14.d: "The people rejoiced when the local preacher [Root.Heir.GetName] was chosen as the heir to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.Country.GetName]. Were they rejoicing because they saw an end to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] constant sermons, or because they believed in [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] being able to make a difference in [Root.Country.GetName]? No matter what, the people support and trust the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Heir.GetName]."

 devotion_events.15.t: "Rule Challenged"
 devotion_events.15.d: "It began, as it always does, with rumors, gossip and sneaked glances filled with contempt and malice. If this challenge to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule goes too far, that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not elected properly to the seat of [Root.Country.GetName], people will no longer speak but might try to depose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]!"
 devotion_events.15.a: "How did this happen?"
 devotion_events.16.t: "Banned Pilgrimages and Superstitious Practices"
 devotion_events.16.d: "The strict, dictatorial attitude of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has provoked the peasants and burghers of [Root.Country.GetName] who demand that the ban on pilgrimages and superstitious practices is lifted. The rage exuded from these simpletons about bans that will in time be beneficial to all is not something to be tampered with."

 devotion_events.17.t: "The Great Feud of [Root.GetName]"
 devotion_events.17.d: "The serious conflict with the city of [Root.GetCapitalName] has gone too far! The citizens have taken some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s vassals prisoner, and despite our best efforts - countering this with anathema and interdict - the city prevails! They have started to strengthen the city's fortifications and will fight any who tries to take the city. We have tried ordering the city to revert the city wall to its previous size, but they refuse."

 devotion_events.18.t: "The Mad Seer"
 devotion_events.18.d: "He claims to be a seer who has seen the civic glory, the destruction of secular art and culture and the great flood that will cleanse [Root.Capital.GetName] from its filth. The mad preacher calls for [Root.Religion.GetName] renewal and has instituted an extreme puritanical campaign. Enlisting the help of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s young men, there is a risk that he will cause disturbances or even dispute [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s right to rule!"

 devotion_events.19.d: "To our chagrin but not our surprise, the perpetual struggle between the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and each institution in [Root.Country.GetName] - ecclesiastical, educational, legal, medical, fiscal, administrative and publicistic - only increases with each new reform suggested. By establishing like-minded people in the various institutions, perhaps that will persuade the reluctant populace to change their minds into a more adaptable form."

The encouragement by [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors made the guilds revolt against the aristocrats and they have opened the city gate to allow [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s army to occupy the city. This is a great opportunity for us to subject the city to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and curtail the city's rights!"

 devotion_events.21.d: "Each incident that lowers our devotion to [Root.Country.GetName] sees more and more trouble approaching our doorstep. There are those that believe that religious considerations should be excluded from civil affairs, and their numbers have grown. They clamor for change, and wish for us to secularize our government."

 devotion_events.21.b: "That drastic step will not be taken yet."
 devotion_events.22.t: "Decadence Rules"

 devotion_events.22.a: "This is a disaster, a pure disaster!"
 devotion_events.23.t: "Corrupt [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 devotion_events.23.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become corrupt, focusing on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal aims rather than the good of the faith. Our people have become disillusioned with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."

 devotion_events.24.a: "Marvelous! Such a great initiative."
 devotion_events.25.t: "The New Monarch"
 devotion_events.25.d: "The life as a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has not been as you imagined it to be, the power you wield is less than what a king or a duke, a caliph or even an Emir has. The pressure of always having to adhere to the strict rules and laws of [Root.Religion.GetName] and to enforce these has left you exhausted. Might it be time, as some of your advisors suggest, to secularize [Root.Country.GetName] and become a ruler of another name?"

 devotion_events.101.d: "The heinous heretical book 'The Lanterne of Light' claims that the principal cause of the persecution of the original Christians was the illegal retention of precious goods by priests. It also goes on to compare the seats of archbishops or bishops with those of the Antichrist. This book has been found in the possession of a relapsed heretic that, despite many years in prison and many tearful abjurations still seem to refuse to change his ways."

 devotion_events.102.d: "One of our cities was granted the privilege to elect its own council and mayor, which of course has led to a constant struggle between them and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s. Besides this struggle of power in the city, it has caused unrest as the burgomasters and town councilors are levying unfair taxes. We need a quick way to assert our authority and regain control of this city, but without alarming the culprits to our intent."

The mayor and the councilors are drinking heavily and will not be able to resist the firm, sober hands of the guards. The animosity between [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the council of the city seems to have dissolved during the several courses of the gala dinner.

 devotion_events.201.d: "Some may argue that the Al-Shura is part of the ruling structure, but not one of its pillars. Meetings should follow the teachings of Islam, consultations the guidelines of the Quran and Sunnah. The leader should be elected from the ones attending to head the meeting. Discussions are based on mushawarah and mudhakarah - deliberation and consensus. Everyone may voice their opinions and the voices of the majority are accepted, as long as it does not violate the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah."

Be not in face of them a voracious animal, counting them as easy prey, for they are of two kinds: either they are your brothers in religion or your equals in creation. Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, evil deeds and sins are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope God will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and God is above him who appointed you. God has sought from you the fulfillment of their requirements and He is trying you with them.'\nA valuable lesson can be learnt from his words, which we could devote ourselves to, or find ways to incorporate into our administration."

It administers the zakat as well, the tax every wealthy Muslim pays and which will be distributed to those in need, unemployed, injured or otherwise incapable to work. This last year, whatever the problems [Root.Country.GetName] had, the inhabitants had a better one. The amount of zakat that flows into the Bayt al-mal exceeds any expectations we might have had.

Ghalib al-Ansari al-Sharrat whose works of legal theory, jurisprudence as well as mysticism show her great knowledge of Islamic sciences, are all great examples of what happens when you educate women. Throughout history, women have shown that they are willing and able to learn about Islam and to continue the work with spreading [Root.Religion.GetName]. Giving women the great opportunity to learn and teach, we will be able to spread our faith much faster."

This is to avoid corruption and bribery, but sometimes the system fails. "

 devotion_events.215.d: "The people of [Root.Country.GetName] are nomads and peasants who live of what the land provides. Our governors need us to decide what we should focus on, taxes or agriculture? One advisor claims that the development of land is more important than the collection of the tax. Tax can only be obtained by the development of the land and to demand tax without doing that will ruin [Root.Country.GetName] and destroy its people. Another claims that people will develop the land without interference if tax is demanded of them and they see a reason behind the demand."

Each has presented their ideas, and we are to choose between two of these. The first one: exclude state officials, such as diplomats and governors, from entering into any business. This to let them fully concentrate on their work and not on anything else, thus hopefully allowing them to do a better job. The second reform: distribute pasture lands and game reserves that now are reserved for the family of the dignitaries among the poor, to cultivate the land. Unpaid labor should also be made illegal."

 devotion_events.217.d: "Each and every province, and every city, should have at least one madrassa, a religious school with free education, delicious food, free books and even stipends to each students provided. There should be annual examinations, and the students who performed splendidly should receive prizes and be recommended for high and honorable positions. Should these teach Hadith, the teachings, deeds and sayings of the prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon him, or should they teach Fiqh and Imaan, theology and belief?"

You look over the material provided as you ponder how to declare a hudna - a truce - and how the settlement should be created in order to maintain the honor and status of both parties. This property dispute is not the first you have to settle, but it is a rare, sensitive one that must be settled in such a way to avert a cycle of revenge.

He tells you of your people's decadence, their crimes and their impious ways. Reminding you sternly of Hisbah, your divinely sanctioned duty to intervene and command right and forbid wrong.

Some however have trouble even accepting the Lutheran Sacramental Union. A recent publication that has gained some circulation in our country seems to have been authored by one of these groups. It will undoubtedly be forgotten soon enough but in the short term the legitimacy of our State Church is being questioned."

When there was suspicion of Witchcraft in the old days the Catholic church would often become involved and might temper the outrage of the local population. The reformation on the other hand has done much to strengthen the belief in popular versions of Christianity.\nA number of women stand accused of Witchcraft in [Root.GetName] and a search has already begun to find more. Local priests and magistrates have gotten involved in the trials but so far state has not been involved.

Thankfully, there are esteemed individuals in [Root.Country.GetName] who would graciously help us with our trading problem. Though it might be silly to call such a small operation 'smuggling', that is exactly what it is and as we might be breaking some of the embargoes our overlord demanded of us, they will probably not be happy with our misconduct."

 subject_interaction_events.15.d: "Our embargoes against our rivals are not working as well as we had hoped them to, and one reason might be that one of our vassals is still trading with them! They are smuggling goods back and forth and thus interfering with our goals and making us appear weak. The smuggling is very minor, but could become very damaging to us.\nOn the other hand powerful business interests would be willing to pay for ignoring the smuggling."

The cowards confessed everything, even for how long this operation had been going on."

 subject_interaction_events.17.t: "War Never Changes"
 subject_interaction_events.17.d: "In exchange for some peace and quiet, our vassals are obliged to pay more income to us, their overlord. They are not called into any of our wars, which we believe is a great trade-off - for some gold they are excluded from almost all wars. One of our vassals wonder if it weren't better if they were called into wars instead of paying these - in their meaning - 'ridiculous sums'."
 subject_interaction_events.17.a: "Ungrateful morons!"
 subject_interaction_events.18.t: "Benefits of Scutage"
 subject_interaction_events.18.d: "As our war-ravaged land are slowly being rebuilt, we have noticed a look in our vassal's ambassador's eyes, a look of comprehension and fear mixed with some relief that the land they are looking at is not their own. 'Now,' they say, 'the gold we pay in scutage to avoid being called into war seems like small sum, something we could easily part with in exchange for peace.'"
 subject_interaction_events.18.a: "We told them this would work!"
 subject_interaction_events.19.t: "Chaotic Conscripts"
 subject_interaction_events.19.d: "The soldiers we sent to one of our vassals as a part of the army subsidizing have gone rogue! They threaten with rebellion unless we withdraw them from our vassal's land and let them come home."
 subject_interaction_events.19.a: "If we close our eyes, maybe they will go away."
 subject_interaction_events.19.b: "Try to soothe these turbulent forces, let them come home if that is what they wish."

 subject_interaction_events.20.d: "We pay loyalists to keep the Liberty Desire in our junior partner's country low and manageable, but the latest reports have become more and more desperate in their pleas for money. Money that they must be squandering, not using it to ensure that the union between our country and theirs remain in place!"

 subject_interaction_events.20.b: "Send them a small sum to secure their loyalty."
 subject_interaction_events.21.t: "The Loyalist Embarrassment"
 subject_interaction_events.21.d: "Though we all appreciate the patriots, the loyalists, the ones who love their country and will protect it to all costs, when they manage to embarrass us in front of the whole court their lovability decreases fiercely. This is not what we pay for, that handsome sum that every month disappears into their greedy pockets! The union we try to protect is worth more than their lice-filled heads."
 subject_interaction_events.21.a: "Off with their heads and put them on the walls of [Root.Capital.GetName]!"
 subject_interaction_events.21.b: "Surely there is something we can do to forget and forgive this unfortunate event?"
 subject_interaction_events.22.t: "Successful Loyalists"
 subject_interaction_events.22.d: "The money sent to loyalists in one of the countries we have a union with has been well spent, more than we could ever have imagined and anticipated. The Liberty Desire of their people has lowered well beyond what we thought possible."
 subject_interaction_events.22.a: "That's a nice surprise!"
 subject_interaction_events.23.t: "Loyalists cause a Rebellion"
 subject_interaction_events.23.d: "A scourge has hit a country who is in a union with us, a scourge of mad men and women armed with whatever weapons they could find. Enraged by the loyalists' behavior, they have risen! Instead of enforcing the bond between us, the loyalists have managed to harm the country and cause rebels to show their ugly mugs."
 subject_interaction_events.23.a: "Try to undo their damage."
 subject_interaction_events.23.b: "There is nothing we can do."
 subject_interaction_events.24.t: "The Cruel Behavior of Uncouth Officers"
 subject_interaction_events.24.d: "'Many small streams creates a large flood' - a proverb that unfortunately proved true in our protectorate. Small events, barely noticeable to us but great slights to those who witnessed or were exposed to them, together with older complains and bitter memories from when the country became our protectorate became the final straw. The deplorable, no, cruel behavior of the officers we sent, has led to a rift and a bad relationship between us and the protectorate."
 subject_interaction_events.24.a: "We need to teach our officers how to become gentlemen!"
 subject_interaction_events.25.t: "A Gentleman and an Officer"
 subject_interaction_events.25.d: "The code of conduct we tried to imprint in every officers' mind before they left our country to work as army instructors in one of our protectorates might not have been time wasted. We have received a message applauding and expressing how impressive the behavior and strict discipline these officers show, and we as a whole country should be proud that we have managed to make gentlemen out of our officers."

 subject_interaction_events.26.d: "We control the trade of our protectorate, and the more we manage to export of all the things they grow and produce, the larger the crop! Somehow we have managed to increase both the quality and quantity of their production, and increased our trade power as well."
 subject_interaction_events.26.a: "Quantity and quality, that's the way."
 subject_interaction_events.27.t: "Exacerbation of Export Effects"
 subject_interaction_events.27.d: "The traders and merchants of our protectorates suffered a major blow to their trade when we decided to take control of their country's trade power. Their complaints about the 'hardships' this mercantile policy has brought upon them reached the ruler of the protectorate, who agrees with them and has made it clear that our relationships with them is suffering because of this."

 subject_interaction_events.28.d: "It is never fun to watch siblings fight - or perhaps it is... especially if those siblings are two countries, one of which is a protectorate of [Root.Country.GetName]. Perhaps we can mediate and see if we can force... negotiate a white peace between them?"

 subject_interaction_events.28.b: "Fight! Fight! Fight!"
 subject_interaction_events.29.t: "Legitimacy Questioned"
 subject_interaction_events.29.d: "Though our grip on the throne of [Root.Country.GetName] may be slipping and our legitimacy questioned, our pride and prestige took a hit when one of our subjects spoke up against us in public. They claim that we have no right in trying to govern them too as we can barely manage our own country."

 subject_interaction_events.29.b: "They may be right, and it should not affect their opinion of us."
 subject_interaction_events.30.t: "The Hole Called Bankruptcy"
 subject_interaction_events.30.d: "A ruler keen of the very best the country can provide, a treasury governed by greedy and incompetent persons, investments that went wrong and too many loans... That is how you dig the hole called bankruptcy, and it might have been all those or just one that made one of our subjects stumble into the hole and fall all the way to the bottom. We can help them get partially out of that hole with a donation of money, or ignore it and make them help themselves."

A concerned Bhikkhu has approached the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] with a warning that unless something is done soon the dire situation may lead to the last few monks abandoning their vows or seeking to join monasteries elsewhere, leaving [Root.GetName] impoverished both spiritually and economically. There are however many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty monastery would leave behind.

A particularly glaring case of a monk breaking his vows and inciting others do to the same has recently come to our attention and many will likely read a great deal into the way we choose to deal with this.

As a result the monasteries of [Root.GetName] are blooming and our state has become known everywhere as an example to follow."
 buddhism_events.8.a: "Demand that they help develop the province."
 buddhism_events.8.b: "Wonderful!"
 buddhism_events.9.t: "The Horrors of War"
 buddhism_events.9.d: "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is however our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."
 buddhism_events.9.a: "We must remember to be gentle."
 buddhism_events.9.b: "Demand that the monasteries release these 'monks' to us."
 buddhism_events.9.c: "Fine the monasteries for any deserter found."
 buddhism_events.10.t: "'Wedge-Throw'"
 buddhism_events.10.d: "The last seasons have not been very kind to the [Root.GetName] region and one of the duties of a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is to take care of the poor. A delegation of farmers has now approached [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] asking to be exempt from taxes and to receive a 3-year loan so that they are able to take care of their families while they work to get back on their feet."
 buddhism_events.10.a: "A reasonable request."
 buddhism_events.10.a.tt: "There is a chance the province recovers and the money may then be returned."
 buddhism_events.10.b: "Sadly the state coffers are also famished."
 buddhism_events.11.t: "Economic Recovery of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.11.d: "[Root.GetName] is now fully recovered from its harsh years and the rice farmers in the area have come to pay back the loan we so graciously granted them."
 buddhism_events.11.a: "Ok."
 buddhism_events.12.t: "Partial Recovery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.12.d: "While the loan we granted the farmers in [Root.GetName] has helped them to slowly turn the area back to its former self they are still unable to pay the debt we once granted them."
 buddhism_events.12.a: "Write it off as a loss."
 buddhism_events.12.b: "Demand repayment."
 buddhism_events.13.t: "'Human Sacrifice'"
 buddhism_events.13.d: "[Root.GetName] is in dire need of better infrastructure. The local monasteries are doing what they can, as are the local aristocrats, but if the area is to prosper the state will have to step in. Plans to improve the situation require extra workers to join in the project from the countryside but all farmers are busy with the harvest. As ruler we can order them to lay down work to participate in construction projects for the common good but in return they will expect to be paid the customary 'Human Sacrifice' or the equivalent of the amount of rice that they could have grown during the same time."
 buddhism_events.13.a: "Pay the Human Sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.13.b: "Abandon the project."
 buddhism_events.13.c: "Demand that the farmers work without compensation."
 buddhism_events.14.t: "Bountiful Harvest"
 buddhism_events.14.d: "This harvest has been unusually bountiful and [Root.Monarch.GetName] could well make use of this unexpected wealth to fund planned religious works. An extra tax has been suggested to transfer the extra grain from the farmers to the state. However traditional Buddhist law dictates that he cannot take more than 10%, the 'Hay Sacrifice', of that which has been harvested and some of our ministers seem uneasy with breaking this rule."
 buddhism_events.14.a: "Levy the tax."
 buddhism_events.14.b: "Let us not steal the fruits of their labor."
 buddhism_events.15.t: "Dana"
 buddhism_events.15.d: "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor a great success and as a result most have food and the state have ample grain supplies. There are however still some unfortunate who haven't got enough food to feed themselves."
 buddhism_events.15.a: "Let us distribute our grain to the poor!"
 buddhism_events.15.b: "Keep it in reserve."
 buddhism_events.16.t: "Vicious Words?"
 buddhism_events.16.d: "The local aristocracy in [Root.GetName] seems to have been growing quite powerful over the last few years. While we retain nominal control over the area much of the real power lies with the local landowners who have been known to grow their domains at the expense of monastery land. This practice, along with other excesses may well be used against them but in order to achieve the full effect we would probably need to embellish the truth a little. There are those who would be willing to do just that for us in exchange for nice positions in our administration afterwards."
 buddhism_events.16.a: "Let us find another way."
 buddhism_events.16.b: "The end justifies the means."
 buddhism_events.17.t: "Pariccaga"
 buddhism_events.17.d: "The willingness of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to risk life and limb in the protection of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people is considered both unusual and worthy of respect. Leading monastic figures have voiced their support for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and some even liken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to an ideal ruler for this self sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.17.a: "Ok."
 buddhism_events.18.t: "Tapa"
 buddhism_events.18.d: "Recently [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come under attack by those who feel his rule has been one of extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Some of our ministers however insist that a certain amount of luxury is necessary for a ruler, especially when dealing with foreign monarchs and their emissaries."
 buddhism_events.18.a: "Let us do away with worldly things!"
 buddhism_events.18.b: "We cannot stoop to the level of peasants..."
 buddhism_events.19.t: "Political Rival Weakened"
 buddhism_events.19.d: "Even a great ruler has some detractors. A particularly successful and outspoken critic of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately gotten himself into a quite hard situation. His friends have left him and high debts make it very hard for him to support his family. While a resourceful person may yet recover from this situation we might also use this opportunity to get rid of this man once and for all."
 buddhism_events.19.a: "Make sure he never recovers!"
 buddhism_events.19.b: "A true [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] holds no grudges."
 buddhism_events.19.c: "This is a time for charity, let us help this man recover."
 buddhism_events.20.t: "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.20.d: "Our willingness to help a rival in need has converted him from a detractor to a firm supporter. With his powerbase rebuilt he is now eager to serve [Root.Monarch.GetName] and apart from his political capital he offers his own services as a minister of our government."
 buddhism_events.20.a: "Great!"
 buddhism_events.21.t: "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.21.d: "Our willingness to help a rival in need may have been a righteous act but now that he has recovered he is as critical as ever of our power. What transpired has perhaps weakened the basis of his position slightly but he is still intent to use all his power to sabotage the government of [Root.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.21.a: "No good deed goes unpunished..."
 buddhism_events.22.t: "Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.22.d: "A representative of the farmers of [Root.GetName] arrived in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, imploring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to help expand and maintain the irrigation system of the province. The local population is growing and claiming new land at a speed that the current infrastructure does not support. The representative also asks that the state supply food to those who need it in the meantime.\nWhile this project would have few downsides besides the cost there are currently no plans to improve this particular region and doing so in reasonable time would likely be quite expensive."
 buddhism_events.22.a: "This [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is always ready to listen to the people."
 buddhism_events.22.b: "You will have to wait for your turn."
 buddhism_events.23.t: "Inheritance"
 buddhism_events.23.d: "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk. The monk in question came from a very influential lay family and during his time in robes had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images and other things. While monks cannot own property as such the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are however others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land they have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."
 buddhism_events.23.a: "Rule in favor of the disciple."
 buddhism_events.23.b: "Rule in favor of the Monastery."
 buddhism_events.23.c: "Support the lay family of the monk."
 buddhism_events.24.t: "Powerful Monastery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.24.d: "The monastaries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have however over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monastaries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."
 buddhism_events.24.a: "A cleansing is required!"
 buddhism_events.24.b: "Seek the blessing of the monks."
 buddhism_events.24.c: "Ignore the situation."
 buddhism_events.25.t: "Banditry in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.25.d: "Bandits have been harassing the province of [Root.GetName] for quite a while now, roads are unsafe and traders have been avoiding the area and taking alternate routes to get past. As local authority isn't as strong in this area as in some other parts of our Empire the brigands have been able to continue unchecked for now. This has become a matter of some concern even outside of the area as the leader of the band has been gaining a reputation as a leader of resistance against central power in general.\nLocal authorities have reached out to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] for help to deal with the problem before it spreads."
 buddhism_events.25.a: "We need to deal with these thieves."
 buddhism_events.25.b: "Let the local authorities handle it."
 buddhism_events.25.a.tt: "State help will help conclude this matter without diverting local funds. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.25.b.tt: "Left to their own devises authorities will have to divert part of the local income to catch the bandits. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.26.t: "Bandit leader caught in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.26.d: "The campaign in [Root.GetName] to catch the leader of the bandits in the area has finally proved successful. During the hunt for him his popularity has only increased however and it is clear this is a very dangerous man to be alive. The commander of the troops that caught the man recommends that we kill him now and not risk that he may one day incite those who idealize him to revolt against us. One of our ministers however wishes to remind [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] that to save a life is better than building a seven level pagoda."
 buddhism_events.26.a: "Kill them all."
 buddhism_events.26.a.tt: "Risk martyring the bandits."
 buddhism_events.26.b: "Banish him and imprison his followers."
 buddhism_events.26.b.tt: "The Bandit leader may return one day."
 buddhism_events.27.t: "Bandit Leader Returns"
 buddhism_events.27.d: "The man we once banished for banditry in one of our provinces seems to have returned to our country, ready to once again make life hard for our local subjects. There is still a lingering popularity in some parts of the country and it is feared he may make good use of this to avoid the authorities once more.\nBy all accounts however he is an older and weaker man now and while the situation is still problematic it seems clear he cannot go on for long this time."
 buddhism_events.27.a: "Ok."
 buddhism_events.28.t: "The Myth Lives on"
 buddhism_events.28.d: "The reputation of the bandit leader we had executed a few years ago has refused to die with him. While his band of brigands can no longer terrorize traders and endanger the integrity of our roads the myth of the bandit leader has grown out of all proportion. Eventually his fate will surely be one of many old stories told to young kids with little meaning, right now however it is a story told to ridicule [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule."
 buddhism_events.28.a: "Ok."
 buddhism_events.29.t: "Foreign Emissary Insults [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.29.d: "The emissary of one of our neighboring countries has given grave affront to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony he was invited to attend. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers however urge caution."
 buddhism_events.29.a: "Publicly deride the ambassador."
 buddhism_events.29.b: "A ruler must never lose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] temper."
 buddhism_events.30.t: "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] accused of favoritism"
 buddhism_events.30.d: "It is with great pleasure that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] have watched some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] childhood friends climb the state hierarchy but now this has made us the target of accusations of favoritism. The local governor of [Root.GetName] has been singled out by this accusations and the situation would undoubtedly be defused by replacing him no matter how competent he has been on that post."
 buddhism_events.30.a: "His services are required by the state."
 buddhism_events.30.b: "We must avoid favoritism at all cost."
 buddhism_events.31.t: "The Laws of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.31.d: "Pali law is generally practiced in one form or another in many Buddhist countries and especially among the Theravada ones. While these laws are not collected and written down by the states themselves they do vary from country to country and at times a collection will have to be updated or renewed. A wise monk has undertaken such a collection recently in [Root.GetName] and has produced an updated version of one of the most commonly used law collections in our country.\nAs the collection itself builds upon actual cases it can however be seen as quite an up to date commentary on the rulings of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.31.a: "Excellent! Promote these laws."
 buddhism_events.31.a.tt1: "As our ruler has not been fair to his subjects this collection of laws reflects badly upon him and will decrease our §YPrestige§!."
 buddhism_events.31.a.tt2: "As our ruler has been fair to his subjects this collection of laws reflects positively upon him and will increase our §YPrestige§!."
 buddhism_events.31.b: "Let us do what we can to stop this from spreading."
 buddhism_events.32.t: "Lawyers at odds"
 buddhism_events.32.d: "Lawyers placing bets on the outcome of a legal dispute is nothing uncommon in our lands and neither is a certain degree of friendly rivalry among the professionals in a courtroom. Once such rivalry turns into actual anger and passion then the integrity of our laws is at stake.\nIt appears two lawyers, each representing powerful patrons, one a rich monastery and the other an aristocrat family of some influence, have gotten caught up in the moment and turned a recent legal conflict about a sizable estate into a heated row. This is very unfortunate and it now falls upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to attempt to salvage the face of both sides in a fair way without compromising the integrity of our courts."
 buddhism_events.32.a: "Demand a retrial with other Lawyers."
 buddhism_events.32.b: "Judge in favor of the monastery."
 buddhism_events.32.c: "Judge in favor of the nobles."
 buddhism_events.32.dd: "Compensate both parties."
 buddhism_events.33.t: "A useful alliance?"
 buddhism_events.33.d: "Many ages ago Mongol rulers adopted the Buddhist religion and sought to spread it among their people. Over the years however many have returned to the old ways of the Shamans. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been fascinated by the legacy of the likes of Kublai Khan and the empires they once created in the name of that religion. As word reach us of a dynamic and growing Tibetan monastic order it was therefore clear to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that this needed to be investigated.\nThe emissary of the Lama now stands before us and has explained that the Lama indeed expects that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a reincarnation of Kublai Khan. He is also prepared to support our rule if we allow him to spread his sect in all the lands we control."
 buddhism_events.33.a: "The time for change has come."
 buddhism_events.33.b: "Let's stick to our old ways."
 buddhism_events.34.t: "Messenger Returns from Tibet"
 buddhism_events.34.d: "Our Messenger from Tibet has returned with news of a powerful religious leader who has become interested in the cause of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his dynasty. If he is to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] however we must be able to do far more than just guarantee his safety. For the Lama to tie his destiny with ours we must swear that he and his future incarnations will be given the proper respect and influence in our realm and that we will create a great Monastery for him and his disciples. If we cannot make these guarantees we will have to content ourselves with receiving a delegation of monks eager to found a new Monastery in our lands."
 buddhism_events.34.a: "Agree."
 buddhism_events.34.b: "Accept the monks."
 buddhism_events.35.t: "Shamanic Figures"
 buddhism_events.35.d: "Conversion from a Shamanist country to a Buddhist one does not happen overnight and a great deal of people within our borders still worship in the old ways. Eager to spread his religion however the foremost Lama in our country have condemned the common Shamanic figures that many common people still honor and demanded that they all be destroyed."
 buddhism_events.35.a: "Burn the Figures."
 buddhism_events.35.b: "Let us give them time..."
 buddhism_events.36.t: "Death of a Lama"
 buddhism_events.36.d: "Our most venerated and honored Lama has died and the search for his reincarnation has begun. While his order is certain they will be able to locate his new self quickly it is likely that some help from the state to fund the expedition would not go amiss."
 buddhism_events.36.a: "Let us give them a hand."
 buddhism_events.36.b: "I'm sure they can handle it."
 buddhism_events.37.t: "Reincarnation Found"
 buddhism_events.37.d: "The order of our old High Lama has managed to find his new self and have enthroned him in their Monastery."
 buddhism_events.37.a: "Long may he live."
 buddhism_events.38.t: "Legitimacy of Incarnation Questioned"
 buddhism_events.38.d: "The intricacies of rebirth can sometimes be lost on the simpler minds. Even though his order insists that their new Lama is a reincarnation of their old leader some people in the countryside have been very hesitant to accept this fact. As they do not recognize him they fear they have been duped and on a few occasions tensions have risen to the point of armed conflict."
 buddhism_events.38.a: "Send envoys to convince them."
 buddhism_events.38.b: "Send troops to convince them."
 buddhism_events.39.t: "Sri Lanka"
 buddhism_events.39.d: "The Island of Lanka, recently conquered by our troops, is full of rich Buddhist monasteries and society seems to be practically run by the monks within them. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally gotten to visit them he stands in awe before the economic and cultural wealth of the monastic orders."
 buddhism_events.39.a: "We must make this part of our culture!"
 buddhism_events.39.b: "Plunder the Monasteries!"
 buddhism_events.40.t: "Religious Guidance"
 buddhism_events.40.d: "The island of Lanka has been the source of a strong Theravada Buddhist tradition for centuries. It is in many ways a model society for a Theravada state and its thriving Monastic communities are the envy of the Buddhist world.\nWhile our own state also follows the Theravada way our laws and traditions are a patchwork of local traditions, ideas from competing Buddhist schools and we lack the strong Monastic infrastructure of the island. Our ministers suggest that in order to remedy this we should send an embassy to Sri Lanka and ask that they send us monks to carry their Theravada traditions to our country."
 buddhism_events.40.a: "Let us send an embassy."
 buddhism_events.40.b: "No, we must support our local sects!"
 buddhism_events.41.t: "An Embassy from [From.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.41.d: "Thriving Monastic communities, holy sacred relics as well as a long tradition of how to handle the coexistence of monastic and regal power make us the envy of many Theravada rulers. It is therefore no suprise that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] should aspire to imitate our greatness. The [From.GetAdjective] embassy that arrived today asks that we allow a number of their monks to travel to our country and receive ordination here in order to bring our traditions to [From.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.41.a: "Allow it."
 buddhism_events.41.b: "They shall do no such thing!"
 buddhism_events.42.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Answer"
 buddhism_events.42.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has allowed 40 monks to receive ordination in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] country. He has also sent a group of nonks directly from his lands to ours to ensure that the Theravada traditions are transfered in a sensible way."
 buddhism_events.42.a: "Great."
 buddhism_events.43.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Answer"
 buddhism_events.43.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle] has sent word that he will not allow our monks to learn the ways of Lankan Buddhism nor will he help us in any other way to develop our religious institutions."

The messenger spoke of fires smoldering and raging in the streets of [From.Capital.GetName] as a metaphor for the discontent and likely rebels that the free city struggles with. They humbly ask for manpower and gold, so that they may be able to deal with this swiftly and efficiently."

Had they been mere peasants, armed with pitchforks and torches and with little military training, we would be able to deal with any revolt they might produce. But these are men and women familiar with war and weapons of all sorts, and should not be underestimated. The only one they might listen to is the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire..."

So far, they have had little success with this but we fear, as we always do when someone are trying to shatter the peace we fight so hard to keep. What will [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.Country.GetName] think of us? Will [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] help us with these unruly nobles?"

The Hanseatic League, for example, where merchant guilds have created a commercial and defensive confederation, or the Swabian League which was a mutual defense and peacekeeping association. The Free City of [From.Country.GetName] has suggested that we join something similar, a cooperation of sorts, where we collaborate in matters of trade, keeping imperial peace, supporting tribunals and perhaps later the maintenance of a unified force."

They have agreed to work together on matters of trade, keeping imperial peace and supporting tribunals. We, as a Free City, could ask for membership in this rather exclusive club..."

 parlaments.20.t: "City Life"
 parlaments.20.d: "As representatives of areas that are sometimes quite distand from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] many MPs often find that life in the capital during their visits is very different to what they are used to. Some find it both cramped and filthy and many seem quite relieved when they get to return home.\nThis year has proved even harder than usual to endure for the delicate sensibilities of our MPs. The hot months have been unusualy hot, the wet months unusually wet and the cold months unusually cold. A number of MPs have now decided that they have had enough and have approached us asking to help make their stays more pleasant."

 parlaments.20.b: "They'll have to endure like the rest of us."
 parlaments.21.t: "MP in Scandal"
 parlaments.21.d: "A minor scandal has occured in the capital during the current debate. It seems rather than attend the sessions himself one of the MPs was out disturbing the public peace and harassing his landlady. The outrage is great both among his peers and in the street and is likely to haunt future parliaments for years."
 parlaments.21.a: "Let it slide."
 parlaments.21.b: "Arrest the MP."
 parlaments.22.t: "Absenteeism"
 parlaments.22.d: "Given its great influence over the politics of our country it would be easy to assume that all MPs attended parliamentary sessions with great enthusiasm, eager to do the most with the power they have been trusted with. This is however far from the case and in any given parliament there will be some that never show up, either because they are still enjoying their estates in the countryside or because they decide to partake in the many joys of the capital. The problem has grown more and more lately and we fear foreign dignitaries are laughing at us behind our backs. There are a number of measures that might be taken to increase attendence but none that the current MPs would take very kindly too."

 parlaments.22.b: "There's nothing we can do."
 parlaments.23.t: "Demands for Representation"
 parlaments.23.d: "A number of hostile publications have begun to circulate in the cities of [Root.GetName].

 parlaments.23.a: "Ban the Publications"
 parlaments.23.b: "Make vague promises of Reform"
 parlaments.24.t: "Financial Aid"
 parlaments.24.d: "Due to the current poor government finances any contribution to the state coffers is very welcome. It is therefore with some enthusiasm that we receive the representatives of a number of rich city assemblies offering to help. Their price  however is greater representation in government in general and formalized ways for the state to ask for their help in the future."

 parlaments.24.c: "Promise to take their views in consideration."
 parlaments.24.dd: "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.25.t: "Demands of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 parlaments.25.d: "While our country lacks a national parliament, local assemblies exist since ancient times in many of our provinces. These have little influence outside of their own provinces but they will sometimes approach the state and their existance allows for a more efficient taxation of the provinces.\nLately trouble have been brewing in [Root.GetName] where a number of such provincial assemblies have recently begun to demand representation at a national level. They feel that they are poorly represented by the central government and that a central parliament where they could offer their opinions to the ruler would be the only way to alleviate this."
 parlaments.25.a: "We will think about it."
 parlaments.25.b: "Such ideas need to be crushed."
 parlaments.26.t: "Direct Contribution"
 parlaments.26.d: "Enthusiastic about the currently debated issue in parliament a group with their interest very much aligned to ours from [Root.GetName] have come to make a direct contribution to the state. It is their hope that the money can be put to good use to 'convince' any MPs that are still opposed or atleast compensate us for any such costs we have had up until now."
 parlaments.26.a: "I'm sure we will find a use for it."
 parlaments.27.t: "Parliamentary Traditions"
 parlaments.27.d: "One of the more difficult things about being a parliamentarian has nothing to do with the debates in the capital but rather how to sell the new laws to the people back home. Still a local MP will often have an easier time to explain a new tax than the collector sent by the central government would in less representative systems.\nIt seems the MPs in general and the ones from [Root.GetName]in particular have become so adept at defending policies that we can see a rise in the support of the central government as a whole as a result."
 parlaments.27.a: "They finally understand me!"
 parlaments.28.t: "Support of local Assembly"
 parlaments.28.d: "The local assembly in [Root.GetName] has been quite enthusiastic in their support of our current proposition in parliament. So much so that they have already begun with the necessary preparations for what they are certain will be a certain approval."
