 exploration_events.1.t: "Ordeal in $PROVINCENAME$"
 exploration_events.1.d: "During our mission to find viable provinces to colonize, we stumbled upon $PROVINCENAME$. Its natives are mostly hostile, but the land is very prosperous. We would gain much from trading with this province. Although we might need to bribe a chief or two..."
 exploration_events.1.a: "Make them a fair deal."
 exploration_events.1.b: "Make them a dishonest deal."
 exploration_events.2.t: "$PROVINCENAME$ Troopers"
 exploration_events.2.d: "Our expedition encountered hostile natives from $PROVINCENAME$ which led them to flee from the province. A few of the crew had disembarked to find fresh water and were returning to the ship when five native canoes with armed men appeared. The crew turned their boat around and raced back to the boat with the canoes just behind. One of the canoes nearly caught up with the boat, but as the men prepared for a fight the canoe slowed down as to wait for the others. The ship escaped, but some of the crew were wounded. A poisoned arrow hit one of the men in the leg, and although the wound was disinfected with urine and olive oil, we do not know if the man will survive."
 exploration_events.2.a: "See if some tawdry trinkets will placate the natives."
 exploration_events.2.b: "Get back there, kill the natives and take their gold!"
 exploration_events.3.t: "Stranger in a Strange Land"
 exploration_events.3.d: "As our ship approaches $PROVINCENAME$ large numbers of gift laden canoes start to follow it. The canoes' occupants have fearlessly boarded the vessel and two seemingly important fellows are trying to persuade the ship's captain to follow them to [Root.GetCapitalName]. Their intentions seem innocent and we can espy from the few words our translator can pick out that we have arrived just in time for a festival of some sort. Our ship's mast formation, sails and rigging resemble certain significant artefacts for the natives and our clockwise route around the island mirrored the path the processions take during this festival. This has convinced the natives that we are friendly but one false move and it might change..."
 exploration_events.3.a: "Accept their primitive traditions."
 exploration_events.3.b: "Stay clear of them and do not make landfall!"
 exploration_events.4.t: "Glory Road"
 exploration_events.4.d: "The lookout had reported signs of dwellings but the ship had yet to see any natives until at long last a coastal village in $PROVINCENAME$ were sighted. A small force disembarked and was hospitably received, something that was attributed to the natives' fascination with the men who were taller in stature than them and bearded. The natives were beardless and with some difficulty they managed to communicate that their myths and legends foretold of a time when their bearded gods would come from the sea to visit them. Food and gold were given, which indicates that the province is prosperous and would be of great value to us."
 exploration_events.4.a: "This is a promising land!"
 exploration_events.5.t: "The Ship into Summer"
 exploration_events.5.d: "The words of Christopher Columbus describe the tribe we found in $PROVINCENAME$ perfectly: 'They traded with us and gave us everything they had, with good will... they took great delight in pleasing us.. They are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil, nor do they murder or steal... Your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people... They love their neighbors as themselves, and they have the sweetest talk in the world, and are gentle and always laughing.'"
 exploration_events.5.a: "Take advantage of them!"
 exploration_events.5.b: "Make good use of their gentle ways."
 exploration_events.6.t: "Unwelcome Passenger"
 exploration_events.6.d: "The village had been abandoned for some time, the failing crops spoke of a drought that must have plagued the province for quite some time. As we returned to our ship, we got a dreadful shock: one of the largest bears we've ever seen trying to climb aboard the ship! The seamen decided to capture the starved beast with the hope of bringing it back to our country, but the bear had other plans. It was leashed and brought aboard the ship, but the bear fought itself free of the ropes and we had to kill it. This attack and the devastated state $PROVINCENAME$ is in has made us realize that it is a lost cause."
 exploration_events.6.a: "A real shame."
 exploration_events.7.t: "The Green Hills of $PROVINCENAME$"
 exploration_events.7.d: "The natives in $PROVINCENAME$ were enthralled by the glass beads, brass bells, and cloth our explorers traded for fresh fish and venison. In their report to us the ship's crew spoke about that there was very little wealth among the people and they seemed peaceful. Some events troubled them, as the villagers for some reason deserted their homes one night and left the village to be explored by the members of the expedition. Nothing much was found, only a small rattle made of gold buried among some fishing nets bore witness that this province might yield some fortune for us."
 exploration_events.7.a: "How great!"
 exploration_events.8.t: "Beyond This Horizon"
 exploration_events.8.d: "As our exploration ship idled off the coast of $PROVINCENAME$, a couple of curious natives in canoes paddled out to the ship. The crew invited the natives aboard after gestures were exchanged that expressed peaceful intentions. Food and drink were shared with the natives before they set back into their canoes and returned to $PROVINCENAME$. Encouraged by the report of the initial pacific encounter, six more canoes decided to paddle out to the caravel."
 exploration_events.8.a: "Invite them again."
 exploration_events.8.b: "Capture them!"
 exploration_events.9.t: "The Menace from $PROVINCENAME$"
 exploration_events.9.d: "After a rather turbulent beginning with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ we finally managed to convince them of our good intentions. As we made landfall two men, one old and one young, approached our ship. They were not interested in our gifts and when a musket was fired over their heads to make them back away, it wounded the older man slightly. He ran to their huts and brought men who threw spears at our crew until they were chased off after two more rounds were fired. The adults fled into the woods, leaving their children behind. Some small trinkets and beads were left behind with the children as a gesture of friendship before the expedition members retreated to the ship."
 exploration_events.9.a: "Make them understand we meant them no harm."
 exploration_events.9.b: "If they return - kill them!"
 exploration_events.10.t: "The $PROVINCENAME$ Beasts"
 exploration_events.10.d: "Before we went on the expedition, we had heard tales of an explorer by the name of Hanno who had found an island populated with a 'hirsute and savage people'. Hanno had made attempts to capture the males which failed, but three females were taken. Their ferocious nature forced the explorer to kill them and to bring proof of this savages, their skins were preserved for transport. These people were called 'gorillae' by the interpreters traveling with Hanno. We assume that the apelike specie we found in $PROVINCENAME$ must be these Gorillae Hanno spoke of."
 exploration_events.10.a: "They can be tamed with some baubles."
 exploration_events.10.b: "Grab what you can and get out!"
 exploration_events.11.t: "A Scattering of Poison"
 exploration_events.11.d: "The expedition was closing in on $PROVINCENAME$ when a barrage of arrows, shot from the natives standing on the inviting beach, assailed the ship. In the hurry to race away from the enemy, who leapt with great whoops towards their canoes, the crew had to abandon some of the men who had been shot and tumbled overboard. When they had laid some sea miles between $PROVINCENAME$ and themselves, they discovered that the whole starboard side of the ship was covered in arrows.\nThe explorer on board the assailed ship was seriously wounded, the arrow that hit him had been poisoned. He lay in fever, sweating and swearing, for several days. Despite the surgeon's care and the disinfectant made of urine and olive oil, he died some time ago."
 exploration_events.11.a: "Such a horrible fate!"
 exploration_events.12.t: "Drunken Explorer"
 exploration_events.12.d: "One of our expedition members - our explorer, of all people! - managed to get himself into a dreadfully embarrassing situation when he overestimated his own capability of handling the fruity liquor the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ brew. Disgusting details won't make it into this report, but he was sick as a pig for a long time. The natives thought it fun, laughing at his misery, but the rumors of this event has reached the ears of the high socialites who frown upon such behavior."
 exploration_events.12.a: "Fruity liquor? Did you bring some back?"
 exploration_events.13.t: "Feathery Meals"
 exploration_events.13.d: "The only residents of $PROVINCENAME$ seem to be birds, birds, and more birds. The large birds, nicknamed 'penguins' by the ship's crew due to their small wings, seem to be fearless of us. The first one we caught stared at us and could not be bothered to fly or run away. When we grabbed it by its leg and held it upside-down, it made a great noise. The flock of penguins around us came running to its assistance and tried to bite us with their large beaks. Our provisions are low and these birds are fat and look good enough to eat."
 exploration_events.13.a: "Leave the birds alone."
 exploration_events.13.b: "If it moves - eat it!"
 exploration_events.14.t: "Unexpected Explorer"
 exploration_events.14.d: "As the ship entered the bay of $PROVINCENAME$, a small crowd of natives had gathered on the beach and were silently regarding the expedition. The ship's mate jumped into a spontaneous and cheerful dance to the accompaniment of pipes. The natives started laughing which broke the tension. Food and drink was brought down to the beach for them all to feast upon. One of the natives showed great interest in the ship, the swords, and other pieces of equipment brought by one of the expedition members. With the help of the translator, the young woman spoke of her knowledge of the nearby islands and of her great desire to see more of the world."
 exploration_events.14.a: "Bring her with you and make an explorer out of her."
 exploration_events.14.b: "It is better for her to stay where she is."
 exploration_events.15.t: "Dead on Arrival"
 exploration_events.15.d: "The life on board a ship is a lonesome one. In a few provinces the expeditions visited there were no shortage of willing arms to embrace and staunch the loneliness for a little while. Overly close contact with the natives may have caused the explorer's death, as he caught a strange disease which rapidly deteriorated his condition and led to heart failure. He was given a burial at sea, not far from $PROVINCENAME$."
 exploration_events.15.a: "Rest in peace."
 exploration_events.16.t: "The First Circumnavigation"
 exploration_events.16.d: "Our fleet set sail from $COUNTRYNAME$ to find a western sea rout to the rich Spice Islands of Indonesia. It took them 99 days to cross the ocean westward, after they had found the Strait of Magellan located near the tip of South America. The strait was treacherous and when they finally reached the ocean, the captain wept with joy. The ocean was so strangely calm it was named 'Pacific', from the Latin word for 'Tranquil'.\n\nThe fleet's captain died from a wound caused by a poisoned arrow when assisting the chief of Cebú in conquering a rival tribe. Two of our ships had survived, one tried to return across the Pacific but perished. The last ship continued west and sailed across the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and as it arrived at our port it became the first ship to circumnavigate the globe."
 exploration_events.16.a: "We are the first to circumnavigate the globe!"
 exploration_events.17.t: "The Second Circumnavigation"
 exploration_events.17.d: "We are not the first to have managed to circumnavigate the globe, but nevertheless it is a great feat and it will be celebrated throughout the land! "
 exploration_events.17.a: "A fabulous feat, even if we were not the first..."

 seven_cities_events.1.t: "El Dorado"
 seven_cities_events.1.d: "An adventurer on his death bed told a tale about a gold covered king who washed the gold off while his attendants threw trinkets of gold and precious stones into the lake. The man claimed to have been rescued by El Hombre Dorado himself and seen the ritual and the golden city with his own eyes. Before he fell ill, he made a crude map that he claims shows the way to El Dorado. Now when we have arrived in $PROVINCENAME$, a landmark corresponds to one of the few roughly drawn on the adventurer's map."
 seven_cities_events.1.a: "Follow that map! It will lead to great treasures."
 seven_cities_events.1.b: "Try to find something of real value."
 seven_cities_events.2.t: "Fountain of Youth"
 seven_cities_events.2.d: "Tales of a fountain that brings eternal youth to anyone who bathes in its waters or drinks from it have long been known. Some have always rejected this idea, while others have searched for it to no avail. We will be successful in finding the Water of Life, this Fountain of Youth, simply because we found someone in $PROVINCENAME$ who has seen it and is willing to take us there - for a price, of course."
 seven_cities_events.2.a: "Pay the man or woman! Anything they want!"
 seven_cities_events.2.b: "Too implausible."
 seven_cities_events.3.t: "Cibola"
 seven_cities_events.3.d: "A scout sent ahead returned with news about Cibola, one of the Seven Cities of Gold. He had met a monk who had heard stories from the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ about a city overflowing with riches. Its people decorated their houses with turquoise, used dishes of gold and silver, and had gigantic pearls, emeralds, and other beautiful gems."
 seven_cities_events.3.a: "Find the monk and persuade him to lead us to Cibola!"
 seven_cities_events.3.b: "Why should we trust such a mad man?"
 seven_cities_events.4.t: "City of the Caesars"
 seven_cities_events.4.d: "A city filled with gold, silver and diamonds... What more could one wish for? Our conquistador has found a landmark indicating that this is the path to the City of the Caesars, which should be located between two mountains, one of diamonds and the other of gold. We need experienced guides, interpreters to talk with the natives, and supplies of many different kinds in order to continue this expedition. The reward will be great, if we find the city."
 seven_cities_events.4.a: "Tell me what you need and you'll get it!"
 seven_cities_events.4.b: "Keep exploring and forget about the City of the Caesars."
 seven_cities_events.5.t: "Sierra de la Plata"
 seven_cities_events.5.d: "The White King rules the region where the Silver Mountains can be found, or so the crew rescued from a shipwreck claims. While being shipwrecked in $PROVINCENAME$, they became friendly with the natives who told them about a great mountain of shining metals, too far into the mainland to reach for many days, if not weeks. The metals they brought give a corn of truth to this legend, and they have offered to join us in a search for the Sierra de la Plata - the Silver Mountains."
 seven_cities_events.5.a: "Bring them and find the silver!"
 seven_cities_events.5.b: "There's not a corn of truth in that!"
 seven_cities_events.6.t: "Norumbega"
 seven_cities_events.6.d: "A French navigator reported that he had found a great river, more than 40 leagues wide and full of islands. According to his notes, fifteen leagues within this river there is a town called Norumbega, with clever inhabitants who trade in furs of all sorts. They are dressed in furs and wearing sable, with a language similar to Latin. These tall and handsome people worship the sun. The town is very rich and there must be a source for the gold most of the people were wearing as jewellery."
 seven_cities_events.6.a: "Send out the conquistador! We must find this place."
 seven_cities_events.6.b: "It's a futile endeavor."
 seven_cities_events.7.t: "Kingdom of Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.7.d: "There have been rumors about a kingdom in the north of the Americas ruled by white, blond men whose treasury is overflowing of gold, silver and rubies. An explorer, his fleet frozen in the mouth of a river, spent a winter in $PROVINCENAME$ and was told about the Kingdom of Saguenay by the natives. With signs and gestures towards his gold-and-silver insignia the natives relayed that precious metals came from the northwest, from a tribe most aggressive and warmongering. They are as white of skin as the explorer himself, and clad similar. The inhabitants of Saguenay are a numerous people, law abiding and wealthy."
 seven_cities_events.7.a: "Go forth and find the Kingdom of Saguenay!"
 seven_cities_events.7.b: "Bah, mere rumors are not good enough. We need proof!"
 seven_cities_events.8.t: "Quivira"
 seven_cities_events.8.d: "The lack of wealth in $PROVINCENAME$ disappointed the conquistador greatly, but the tales told by a native known as 'The Turk' cheered him up. A wealthy civilization named Quivira lies far to the east - or was it north? - of $PROVINCENAME$, where the chief drink from golden cups hanging from the trees."
 seven_cities_events.8.a: "Find the golden cups of Quivira!"
 seven_cities_events.8.b: "A fruitless endeavor, I'm sure."
 seven_cities_events.100.t: "The Death of a Conquistador"
 seven_cities_events.100.d: "The expedition had sent forth a scout with the instructions of sending back crosses to the main party with the size of the cross equal to the wealth discovered. When this unfortunate event happened, a cross tall as a person had arrived and the main party picked up their pace. As they entered [Root.GetCapitalName], they found that the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ had killed the scout and were waiting for the rest of the party. Most fell to the savages, but a desperate few managed to escape. They tell us that the conquistador was one of the first to die, and that the scout was to blame. He had offered a gift of a gourd with a red feather, which turned out to be the native's symbol for war."
 seven_cities_events.100.a: "We mourn the loss of a great conquistador."
 seven_cities_events.101.t: "Eat Leather or Starve to Death"
 seven_cities_events.101.d: "The expedition was low on supplies even before we entered $PROVINCENAME$, but now we have to survive off what the land provides - which isn't much. Snakes taste like chicken and leather... Close your eyes hard as you chew on boiled leather from your scabbard or armor, and you might believe that it is beef jerky you are chewing on. Please send help, or we will never reach our destination."
 seven_cities_events.101.a: "Help will be sent!"
 seven_cities_events.101.b: "Find some natives and have them feed you."
 seven_cities_events.102.t: "When Natives Attack"
 seven_cities_events.102.d: "They were a terrifying sight, these half-clothed women with spears, clubs, bows and arrows in their hands and the sound that emerged from their throats as terrifying as the roar from a tiger! These warrior women from $PROVINCENAME$ were named Amazons by the survivors of our expedition and those they did not wound or kill were taken prisoner. Among them was the conquistador, the leader of this quest."
 seven_cities_events.102.a: "Find them and persuade them to release their captives!"
 seven_cities_events.102.b: "They will release him and the rest when they tire of him."
 seven_cities_events.103.t: "A Glimmer of Hope"
 seven_cities_events.103.d: "We have fought off natives, ate strange fruit and stranger animals, caught diseases that no one should ever have to endure, and despaired for every step leading us away from inhabited cities. The only thing that has kept us moving forward was the stubbornness, the curiosity, and the firm belief of our leader that we will find the place we are looking for. Even their iron will seems to have faded these last days, and had it not been for a great discovery in $PROVINCENAME$, they would have ordered our retreat."
 seven_cities_events.103.a: "We found gold?!"
 seven_cities_events.104.t: "Spirited Away"
 seven_cities_events.104.d: "It could be the guards' fault, for they slept on their watch. Or was it the native, who we hired to lead us through the inhospitable $PROVINCENAME$, who is to blame? Maybe it was the conquistador who slept so soundly through it all that they did not even wake up to scream and yell as the natives silently made off with them into the deep forests. Either way: Our conquistador disappeared in the night and we need to go look for them."
 seven_cities_events.104.a: "Take some soldiers and go find the conquistador!"
 seven_cities_events.104.b: "They'll turn up, sooner or later."
 seven_cities_events.105.t: "Long Pig"
 seven_cities_events.105.d: "The expedition stumbled upon a small, friendly tribe of natives in $PROVINCENAME$ who invited them to a feast to celebrate a recent victory over a neighboring tribe. There was plenty of meat, with a taste that reminded the conquistador of pork, and the name was apparently 'long pig'. It wasn't until after the feast the source of meat was explained: Captives from the defeated tribe sacrificed and eaten to gain the strengths of their enemies..."
 seven_cities_events.105.a: "Any rumors of this must be silenced!"
 seven_cities_events.105.b: "Pray that the conquistador keeps their mouth shut."
 seven_cities_events.200.t: "El Dorado - a myth"
 seven_cities_events.200.d: "Years of struggle - or so it must have felt - have yielded next to nothing! The conquistador has given up the quest for El Dorado, claiming that the city of gold is nothing but myth and legend. A few provinces found, a few natives pleased with baubles and trinkets - but no gold, no diamonds, and certainly not a city with streets laden with gold."
 seven_cities_events.200.a: "What a pity."
 seven_cities_events.201.t: "El Dorado - City Under Water"
 seven_cities_events.201.d: "Lake Guatavita is rumored to be the lake where the Golden King washes off the gold dust he is covered with in a ritual that stretches over several days. Several trinkets made of gold and covered in precious stones have been found in the water, and our conquistador has started an ambitious project: Try and drain the lake by using a 'bucket chain' of laborers. Though they have worked tirelessly for three months, the water level has only been reduced by ten feet, and only a small amount of gold has been recovered."
 seven_cities_events.201.a: "It is better than nothing."
 seven_cities_events.202.t: "The Discovery of El Dorado!"
 seven_cities_events.202.d: "Houses decorated with gold, statues covered in precious stones and a lake with its bed covered in gold dust, gems and other valuables... El Dorado has been found and its wealth is immense! Not only will this bring a great deal of wealth to our own country, but also prestige and the admiration of other countries."
 seven_cities_events.202.a: "The conquistador will be rewarded!"
 seven_cities_events.203.t: "Fountain of Youth - Death by Water"
 seven_cities_events.203.d: "After many months of trekking through provinces filled with poisonous plants, venomous snakes, frogs and insects, dangerous animals of all kinds and sizes, the puddle in $PROVINCENAME$ known as the Fountain of Youth was finally found. Its water is muddy brown and it is cursed with a stench that could awaken even the dead. Only one brave soul volunteered to drink from the Water of Life and his body was buried the day after, ravaged by diarrhoea and violent heaves."
 seven_cities_events.203.a: "He chose... poorly"
 seven_cities_events.204.t: "Fountain of Youth - Refreshing Water"
 seven_cities_events.204.d: "A small waterfall feeds into the Fountain of Youth in $PROVINCENAME$, whose bright blue, crystal-clear water looks almost as good as it tastes. Our weary expedition members claim that bathing in the water refreshed them both physically and mentally, clearing most of the tiredness and all of the grime from their minds and bodies. But it did not last long, only hours after their baths the tiredness was back, and water brought in canteens from the lake only quenched their thirst."
 seven_cities_events.204.a: "Good while it lasted, at least."
 seven_cities_events.205.t: "Fountain of Youth - True Water of Life"
 seven_cities_events.205.d: "Wrinkles faded away, eyesights improved, gout disappeared and troubled minds finally found peace. Water sweeter than nectar, clearer than any cut diamond, and more well-guarded than the crown jewels of any country - but now it is ours: The Fountain of Youth! Be careful though, as imbibing in the precious water might cause some... unforeseen side effects. Too much of the good stuff and all that."
 seven_cities_events.205.a: "Perfect! Just ration the water and we are good to go."
 seven_cities_events.206.t: "Cibola - The Monk's Lies"
 seven_cities_events.206.d: "The small city with ramshackle adobes and dirty streets, nothing like the houses made of gold and streets paved with precious stones described to us, met our conquistador and the expedition when they finally reached 'Cibola' in $PROVINCENAME$. The monk tried to stutter an explanation, about seeing the city in a different light - perhaps a sunset would paint it golden? But nothing he said could quell the rage and disappointment everyone felt."
 seven_cities_events.206.a: "He lied? He lied to US?!"
 seven_cities_events.207.t: "Cibola - Not Quite Golden"
 seven_cities_events.207.d: "There was some gold, and a few precious stones, but it was fiercely guarded by the natives of $PROVINCENAME$. The monk who led us to 'Cibola' disappeared not long after the discovery, and most of the gold with him. Some trinkets and gold dust was recovered, not nearly enough to give Cibola the reputation as one of the Seven Cities of Gold."
 seven_cities_events.207.a: "There must be some truth to at least one of these myths!"
 seven_cities_events.208.t: "Golden Discovery - Cibola"
 seven_cities_events.208.d: "Wealth comes in many different packages and ways - some claim that the wealth of heart is to be desired, others that piety and prestige should be the only wealth in life. Gold and precious stones is the only wealth our heart desires, and the Golden City of Cibola in $PROVINCENAME$ has made this desire grow fiercely. For every ounce of gold, for every handful of gems we want more and Cibola keeps on giving. One of the Seven Cities of Gold is ours, and we intend to keep it."
 seven_cities_events.208.a: "It is ours, our precious..."
 seven_cities_events.209.t: "City of the Caesars - False Gold"
 seven_cities_events.209.d: "Everything that glimmers is not gold - something our conquistador learned the hard way. The expedition claimed to have found the City of the Caesars in $PROVINCENAME$, a golden city located between two mountains of gold and diamonds. Sadly, the 'gold' was mere pyrite and the 'diamonds' were quartz."
 seven_cities_events.209.a: "I would have preferred something more... precious."
 seven_cities_events.210.t: "City of the Caesars - True Silver"
 seven_cities_events.210.d: "Mountains of gold and diamonds, and beneath it one of the Seven Cities of Gold... The mountains were only two small hills in $PROVINCENAME$. They held some precious metal and stones, but the metal was not the color of the sun but the color of the moon - a handful of silver and quartz was all the conquistador could find."
 seven_cities_events.210.a: "It's better than nothing."
 seven_cities_events.211.t: "The City of the Caesars - Mountains of Wealth"
 seven_cities_events.211.d: "Between the two large mountains of gold and diamonds in $PROVINCENAME$ lie the City of the Caesars, a prosperous city filled with everything you could wish. Food and drink aplenty, eaten and drunk from gold plates rimmed with precious stones. We have found it and claimed it, and we will be rich when all that wealth has been transported home."
 seven_cities_events.211.a: "Just think about all that gold and prestige this will bring!"
 seven_cities_events.212.t: "Sierra de la Plata and the False King"
 seven_cities_events.212.d: "There was a White King in $PROVINCENAME$ but his Mountain of Silver was a hoax. Sierra de la Plata is yet another myth too many fools have fallen for, and we have to admit that we were another of them."
 seven_cities_events.212.a: "It was too good to be true."
 seven_cities_events.213.t: "Sierra de la Plata - Close, but no Silver"
 seven_cities_events.213.d: "Not a mountain of silver, not one of the Seven Cities of Gold, but Sierra de la Plata was a true legend found by us - finally! It was located in $PROVINCENAME$ and an adequate amount of silver is being brought back each month to us."
 seven_cities_events.213.a: "Good!"
 seven_cities_events.214.t: "Sierra de la Plata - Mountain of Silver"
 seven_cities_events.214.d: "Beneath a large mountain filled with silver a White King resides. Sierra de la Plata - Mountains of Silver - has grown from a legend to a real city in $PROVINCENAME$ and we were the first civilized people to find it! Rejoice, for we have found a place of immense wealth and a people so gullible we will have no problem taking what we want, nay, what we need!"
 seven_cities_events.214.a: "Great!"
 seven_cities_events.215.t: "No Trace of Norumbega"
 seven_cities_events.215.d: "The city of Norumbega must be a hoax made up by the French navigator who claimed to have discovered it. The only 40-leagues-wide river is devoid of islands and there is no sign of a town farther up. We have been gullible enough to believe something as preposterous as a Viking settlement and wasted time to try and find it."
 seven_cities_events.215.a: "Too bad..."
 seven_cities_events.216.t: "Disappointing Norumbega"
 seven_cities_events.216.d: "The town lay exactly where the French navigator had reported, at the mouth of a river 40 leagues wide. There was no sight of the tall, handsome and clever inhabitants he had spoken of, but the natives were very friendly and had lots of furs and sable to trade."
 seven_cities_events.216.a: "I had expected more."
 seven_cities_events.217.t: "Norumbega Discovered"
 seven_cities_events.217.d: "The people of Norumbega are tall, clever and handsome, with a language which shares a lot of words with Latin. We had hoped for a small town with some gold and furs, but Norumbega far exceeded all our expectations with its rich land, gold mine, and fur trade. It is an old Viking settlement, so much have we gathered from the people, and they are willing to trade with us. The gold mine seems to contain an endless stream of gold and as long as we provide our own work force, we are allowed to mine it."
 seven_cities_events.217.a: "This is great news!"
 seven_cities_events.218.t: "Mere Myths - Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.218.d: "Charts painted with great care, landmarks discovered and natives guiding us, despite all this we have come no closer to finding the Kingdom of Saguenay. This is a hopeless quest, there is nothing of value in the north-west of the Americas. Let the conquistador come back home, or send the expedition out to search for something more tangible, something that is more than a myth or legend told by ignorant and savage natives."
 seven_cities_events.218.a: "We have no other choice. End the search for Saguenay."
 seven_cities_events.219.t: "Hoax by Indians - Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.219.d: "As the expedition neared its destination - the legendary Kingdom of Saguenay, on par with any of the Seven Cities of Gold - El Dorado included - the anticipation grew with every step. Silver mines, ruby mines and gold mines - the mere thought of the treasures awaiting made most of the crew salivate. The first sight was a palisade encircling the town and smiles of greed was plastered on every face. These were soon exchanged for looks of disbeliefs and hearts turning to stone in their chests. The inhabitants were not white, were not clad in similar clothes to us and were certainly not wealthy. It was yet another tribe of natives, with more riches than most but this was no City of Gold."
 seven_cities_events.219.a: "They are willing to trade, that is something at least."
 seven_cities_events.220.t: "The Discovery of the Kingdom of Saguenay"
 seven_cities_events.220.d: "The expedition was greeted with great hospitality by the white inhabitants of the Kingdom of Saguenay. They told a saga of having traveled on great boats some hundred years ago or so to Vinland as they call this continent. Gold, silver and ruby mines were soon found and tribes around became interested in their findings, leading the Saguenais to build up a reputation as fierce and brutal warriors. They reluctantly shared their wealth with us after we showed our superiority with guns and swords."
 seven_cities_events.220.a: "This is glorious!"
 seven_cities_events.221.t: "Nothing but Abodes"
 seven_cities_events.221.d: "'The Turk' filled the conquistador's ears with tales of the wealthy city of Quivira, of the fat land well watered by springs and rivers, the gold that adorned the houses and the fat, happy people. What the expedition found, however, was just more farming people living in a flat-roofed adobe town!"
 seven_cities_events.221.a: "The Turk should be strangled for his lies!"
 seven_cities_events.222.t: "Fruitful City"
 seven_cities_events.222.d: "Quivira is a well settled town, with the land itself being very flat and black. Rivulets, springs and rivers ensure that it is well watered. Prunes, nuts, sweet grapes, and mulberries were found in excess. There are abundant jade deposits in the caves, but no gold at all. The legendary city exists, and although wealthy, it is not how we were told to picture it."
 seven_cities_events.222.a: "At least we found it."
 seven_cities_events.223.t: "Legendary City of Quivira"
 seven_cities_events.223.d: "Golden cups hang from the trees in the city of Quivira and anyone who is thirsty may take one and fill it with sweet water from one of the many springs, rivers, and rivulets that keep the area well watered. Prunes, nuts, mulberries, and sweet grapes bigger than anyone has ever seen must be the reason behind the large people of good build that inhabits the city. Gold and jade in great deposits in caves ensure the wealth of the city."
 seven_cities_events.223.a: "We have found it! Finally!"

 seven_cities_events.300.d: "While replenishing our supplies in $PROVINCENAME$, a young, pregnant woman and her husband, a well-known trapper, applied for the positions of interpreter and guide in our expedition. The woman speaks several languages while her husband is a good hunter with great knowledge of this continent."
 seven_cities_events.300.a: "Hire them."

 seven_cities_events.301.t: "Saved by a Princess"
 seven_cities_events.301.d: "We cannot imagine the terror our conquistador must have felt when he laid his head onto a great stone while seeing men standing ready with clubs above his head. Luckily for him, the chief's dearest daughter rushed forth and placed her head upon his to save him from death."
 seven_cities_events.301.a: "We must make sure this does not happen again."
 seven_cities_events.301.b: "They are barbarians!"
 seven_cities_events.302.t: "Attacked by Natives"
 seven_cities_events.302.d: "Tragic news: our conquistador is dead! The expedition was travelling upriver by canoe when they encountered natives. The warlike tribe demanded that they come ashore and some of the men complied. They were disarmed and stripped naked, something our conquistador objected to. He refused the orders and died riddled with bullets. The expedition members saw his body brought ashore and hacked to pieces. Only one survived, who was told to leave and run. The natives pursued him and he ran for his life. Naked, exhausted and bleeding, the survivor had only one assailant pursuing him after several miles. He managed to overcome the lone man and found shelter in $PROVINCENAME$."
 seven_cities_events.302.a: "How terrible!"
 seven_cities_events.303.t: "Lost in Mind and Space"
 seven_cities_events.303.d: "We should have realized that our conquistador had no sense of orientation at all the first two times he got lost. The first time, he went to retrieve two of our pack horses and got lost for sixteen days. If it hadn't been for some grapes and rabbits, he would have starved. He later told us that he thought he was behind the expedition and sped up to catch up with it, then he got hungry so he went downstream to look for a trading party. The expedition sent their best hunter to find him and were finally reunited with him. The second time he explored one of three forks of a river and disappeared for three days. Once again the expedition sent the seasoned hunter to find him and he told a tale of trying to backtrack the forks and following our trails. This made the crew decide that the conquistador would not be left alone to discover more parts of $PROVINCENAME$, but that still did not help. Only mere minutes later he was gone again."
 seven_cities_events.303.a: "Send the hunter out again."
 seven_cities_events.303.b: "Leave him. He'll have to find us this time."
 seven_cities_events.304.t: "A Dog's Life"
 seven_cities_events.304.d: "A big, black dog by the name of Seaman had accompanied the expedition from the start, and had experienced many adventures. A beaver had bit him so badly that the expedition's doctor had to perform surgery on his hind leg. Mosquitoes plagued the expedition and the dog had howled with the torture experienced by them. Natives in $PROVINCENAME$ had stolen Seaman but he was retrieved shortly. Our conquistador has grown fond of the dog and would be devastated if anything happened to him."
 seven_cities_events.304.a: "The tribes in $PROVINCENAME$ will know our wrath if anything happens to that dog!"
 seven_cities_events.304.b: "It's only a dog."
 seven_cities_events.305.t: "Faster, slowpokes!"
 seven_cities_events.305.d: "The natives of $PROVINCENAME$ have not been exactly friendly to our expedition. The ones we met tried to steal our weapons during the night and during the struggle two natives were killed. Our crew managed to flee over 100 miles in a day before they dared camp again. There are signs that the natives are after them once more, and they might find the strength to repeat the marathon march if encouraged..."
 seven_cities_events.305.a: "Flee, you fools!"
 seven_cities_events.306.t: "Waving the White Flag"
 seven_cities_events.306.d: "Two tribes, one from $COUNTRY$ and one from a neighboring country are rivals, something our conquistador didn't realize until too late. They both demanded tribute from the expedition to allow them passage. By offering one native chief gifts first, our conquistador insulted and angered the other chief. The gifts offered were not to the chiefs' satisfactory and some warriors tried to take the expedition's provisions. The conquistador took a firm stand and presented arms, his second in command brandished his sword and threatened violence. The chiefs backed down and better gifts were presented to them both."
 seven_cities_events.306.a: "Try to make them bury the hatchet."
 seven_cities_events.306.b: "Good work!"
 seven_cities_events.307.t: "Bleeding Gums and Falling Teeth"
 seven_cities_events.307.d: "With a diet consisting mostly of cured and salted meat and dried grains, the malaise and lethargy should have been the first symptoms recognized as scurvy, but it was not until gums started bleeding and teeth falling out that we realized we had to do something to save our expedition members. As they are exploring provinces that have an unknown flora and fauna to us, it would be unwise to eat anything as it could be poisonous. Maybe we should try to establish contact with the natives of $PROVINCENAME$ and ask for their help?"
 seven_cities_events.307.a: "Trade for the medicine!"
 seven_cities_events.307.b: "No, try eating some fruit first."
 seven_cities_events.308.t: "The Amazons"
 seven_cities_events.308.d: "In $PROVINCENAME$ there are two small tribes with a very special arrangement: The women live by themselves, far from the men who they only allow to visit them a couple of times each year. Any boy child fathered this way is returned to the father and the girls are kept by the women. If approached at any other time than is appointed, the women will defend themselves with bows and arrows. The men of the strange tribe are currently preparing for the next visit, and have invited the male expedition members to join them."
 seven_cities_events.308.a: "That sounds like a bad idea."
 seven_cities_events.308.b: "This might be the only way to learn more about these strange customs."
 seven_cities_events.309.t: "Mutiny in $PROVINCENAME$!"
 seven_cities_events.309.d: "Several crew members of the conquistador's expedition were captivated by the idyllic life in $PROVINCENAME$ and decided to abandon the expedition. This was declared an act of mutiny by the conquistador and after a long hunt, the mutineers were captured. Should they be sent back to us and tried here, or should they be forgiven and allowed to return to the expedition as crew members after a bit of flogging?"
 seven_cities_events.309.a: "Send them back."
 seven_cities_events.309.b: "Flog them."
 seven_cities_events.310.t: "Wintering among the Natives"
 seven_cities_events.310.d: "In the province of $PROVINCENAME$, our conquistador encountered natives who proved so friendly and welcoming that he lost sight of the time spent among them. His expedition was forced to spend the winter with their native friends and allies, but built up relations in doing so."
 seven_cities_events.310.a: "He wasted time but gained friends... good."
 seven_cities_events.400.t: "The Survivor"
 seven_cities_events.400.d: "The expedition started with 600 men, but only four made it home alive. When they first arrived, the crew heard about another expedition where 450 of 600 men had perished. Fearing that they would face the same fate, many deserted. A hurricane struck the expedition not long after, and several men perished. Disaster after disaster struck the expedition, famine, disease and attacks from the natives. One of the four who returned home was Estevanico, a black slave born in Africa, who was taught by the conquistador the necessary skills to lead an expedition. He is available for hire, although we would suffer a small prestige hit if we appoint him our new conquistador."
 seven_cities_events.400.a: "Hire Estevanico, we need a new conquistador."
 seven_cities_events.400.b: "No, we will find a more suitable person for that."
 seven_cities_events.401.t: "Drunken Whiskey Thieves"
 seven_cities_events.401.d: "Found singing loud, lecherous songs and swigging whiskey straight from the bottle, the two men were clearly guilty of their crime. To steal whiskey and drink it while on duty - how unprofessional! They were tried in martial court and sentenced to flogging, then released."
 seven_cities_events.401.a: "They did not deserve a flogging!"
 seven_cities_events.401.b: "That taught them a lesson!"
 seven_cities_events.401.c: "Hopefully this did not avert them too long from their goal..."
 seven_cities_events.402.t: "Peralta Gold Mine"
 seven_cities_events.402.d: "The bloody massacre in $PROVINCENAME$ left few Peralta family members alive when natives attacked their routine gold expedition. The ones who survived have begged for the help of our conquistador and the soldiers of our expedition, promising much gold if their family is avenged."
 seven_cities_events.402.a: "Whatever they need - as long as we get that gold!"
 seven_cities_events.402.b: "The expedition has more pressing matters to attend to."
 seven_cities_events.403.t: "Gold and Diamonds"
 seven_cities_events.403.d: "The remaining members of the Peralta family led us to the place of the massacre. The bodies were left untouched, the wagons destroyed... Our expedition helped bury the bodies while several scouts searched the area for any signs of the attackers. A few clues led toward the Peralta gold mine and as they approached it became clear that the attackers had taken shelter in the mines. One of the Peraltas confirmed that it was the same group that had attacked them. After a violent battle, the enemy lay dead on the ground outside the mine. The Peralta family kept their word and rewarded us with a large amount of gold."
 seven_cities_events.403.a: "Honest pay for honest work."
 seven_cities_events.404.t: "Quartz and Pyrite"
 seven_cities_events.404.d: "The bodies of the fallen Peralta family members had been savaged, which made it difficult to identify them. Burying them took precious time, and the scout sent out to search the surrounding areas for the attackers returned with nothing. The oldest son of the Peraltas, one of the few survivors, refused to give up. He led the expedition towards the Peralta gold mine, in case the attackers had found their way there. As they approached the mine, their fears were confirmed. The mine is no more, the attackers buried it in rubble and the gold is lost. The Peralta family was avenged, as the large group of attackers were taken by surprise and easily killed."
 seven_cities_events.404.a: "That's... something, at least."
 seven_cities_events.405.t: "He's a Woman!"
 seven_cities_events.405.d: "We would never had discovered that Baret was a woman had the natives not shouted it at the top of their lungs when the expedition entered $PROVINCENAME$. She had joined us as an assistant to our naturalist and as his ulcerated leg had brought him much discomfort, she had carried supplies and specimens in his stead. Baret claims to be our naturalist's housekeeper, but their relationship seems deeper than that. Should we allow her to remain with us on the expedition?"
 seven_cities_events.405.a: "Yes, allow her to stay."
 seven_cities_events.405.b: "No, send her back!"
 seven_cities_events.406.t: "Poison Rock"
 seven_cities_events.406.d: "Nine horses died from eating poisonous plants, and the expedition was forced to leave behind two more who were near death. A cursed place with only poisonous plants and venomous animals and the conquistador regrets that they ever decided to camp there. A large rock formation provided shelter from the harsh winds that blew right through them, but Poison Rock, as it was named by the conquistador, is not a place for any man nor animal."
 seven_cities_events.406.a: "Continue on foot if you have to!"
 seven_cities_events.407.t: "False as diamonds of $PROVINCENAME$"
 seven_cities_events.407.d: "Our explorer has sent us gems he claims to have found in $PROVINCENAME$. White and glittering, he believes them to be diamond, but our learned scholars tell us that they are common quartz instead. Far from a source of wealth, they have become a source of ridicule..."
 seven_cities_events.407.a: "All is not diamonds that glimmer."
 seven_cities_events.408.t: "A Deserter Resurfaces!"
 seven_cities_events.408.d: "Words from our conquistador warned us that one of his trusted lieutenants had defected in despair at the state of the expedition. Our conquistador thought we had seen the last of this deserter, but our agents inform us that he has resurfaced and is peddling his charts to the merchants and explorers of our rival..."
 seven_cities_events.408.a: "Stop him, discreetly."
 seven_cities_events.408.b: "Kill him and make an example out of him!"
 seven_cities_events.409.t: "An account of the New Lands"
 seven_cities_events.409.d: "Our conquistador may not have sent back gold, but he has sent back a magnificently detailed map of our new domains, and of all the unclaimed land waiting only for brave settlers to claim their destiny..."
 seven_cities_events.409.a: "That's surprisingly good news, despite the lack of gold."
 seven_cities_events.410.t: "Abandoned Mounds"
 seven_cities_events.410.d: "From a distance, our conquistadors thought them to be mere hills standing among the otherwise empty plain in $PROVINCENAME$. But as we drew nearer, an enterprising fellow in the company noticed how regular they were, and he soon pointed out to his companions that they must be the remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people."
 seven_cities_events.410.a: "There must be gold underneath those hills! Dig them out, now!"
 seven_cities_events.410.b: "Leave them be, there's nothing but earth underneath them."
 seven_cities_events.411.t: "Nothing but dirt"
 seven_cities_events.411.d: "They were nothing but mere hills, that 'enterprising fellow' who thought them to be remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people was wrong. Dirt was all the expedition found."
 seven_cities_events.411.a: "How disappointing!"
 seven_cities_events.412.t: "Meager amount of Gold"
 seven_cities_events.412.d: "The hills were the remnants of the great pyramids of an ancient people and the expedition found some gold in all that dirt. Although the expedition crew believed this to be a waste of time, and we do agree."
 seven_cities_events.412.a: "We got some gold, that's good."
 seven_cities_events.413.t: "Hic Sunt Dracones"
 seven_cities_events.413.d: "The paint on the great rock that dominates the river is almost faded, but the six-legged, monster it displays is still visible. Our natives tell us a fanciful tale of a dragon-like monster slain by their ancestors, but some of them confusedly insist the painting to be a warning that we should not head further. What is certain is that all of our native guides insist on discharging their weapons at the painted figure as we pass by it."
 seven_cities_events.413.a: "Let us conserve our ammunition."
 seven_cities_events.413.b: "Let us support their war on the beast."
 seven_cities_events.414.t: "A Most Deadly lake"
 seven_cities_events.414.d: "The natives whisper and throw evil glances toward the still water. They say that there is a spirit there, in the form of a great serpent or monster. They claim that this spirit ambushes canoes on the surface, pulling them to a watery grave. It may not be the work of monsters, but perhaps it would be wise to go the long way around?"
 seven_cities_events.414.a: "Go around it."
 seven_cities_events.414.b: "There are no such thing as monsters, take the fast way across."

 seven_cities_events.500.d: "$FROMCOUNTRY$'s conquistador has admitted that their expedition members ate human flesh!

 nahuatl_reform_1_desc: "Our society has traditionally restricted the use of finer clothing, jewelry or even the amount of stories a house may have to the hereditary nobility. By opening up these perks to anyone who performs well on the field of battle we can create a state where every member of our society is ready to do their part in times of war."
 nahuatl_reform_2: "Extend Pochteca Obligations"
 nahuatl_reform_2_desc: "The Pochteca trade guilds have often come to act as our emissaries, diplomats and spies in relations with other city states. Let us formalize this relationship into a set of strict obligations to more efficiently handle our foreign relations."
 nahuatl_reform_3: "Warrior Ranks"
 nahuatl_reform_3_desc: "By creating a system of ranks dependent on how many captives a warrior has taken during his career we can encourage each warrior in our armies to strive towards constantly improving his skills."
 nahuatl_reform_4: "Tribal Expansion"

 nahuatl_reform_5: "Legal Reform"
 nahuatl_reform_5_desc: "Until now the city states under our control have all had their respective legal systems controlled by their own respective judges. Let us create a set of central laws that need to apply throughout our empire and start educating judges centrally."
 inti_reforms: "Inti Reforms"
 inti_reform_1: "Organized Recruitment"
 inti_reform_1_desc: "While our subject peoples have always supplied troops for our armies they have done so to varying degrees and in an ad-hoc manner. By formalizing the need for every subjugated area to supply soldiers to the central state we will be able to tap the manpower resources of our lands in a much more efficient manner."
 inti_reform_2: "Expanded Mitma Policy"
 inti_reform_2_desc: "The policy of moving entire villages from loyal territories into newly conquered land or into the frontier has helped expand the empire. This type of forced resettlement could also be used to resettle the population of newly conquered areas into the core territory of the empire. Strict laws should be put in place to forbid people from returning to their original homes."
 inti_reform_3: "Reform the Cult of Inti"
 inti_reform_3_desc: "While Inti, the sun, is the foremost of all gods most of the peoples of the Andes also worship a variety of minor Huacas. We must require all corners of our empire to acknowledge Inti as their main god and that all Huaca idols are given to be kept by our ruler as Inti's foremost representative."
 inti_reform_4: "Yana Lords"
 inti_reform_4_desc: "By moving away from the hereditary or local powerholders as the commanders of our armies we can instead promote a new class of leaders appointed directly by the state.

A unified army structure would ensure that less resources are wasted."
 mesoamerican_reform_2: "Central Arbitration"
 mesoamerican_reform_2_desc: "While they are unified under our rule, the city states of our empire frequently get into conflict with each other over everything from trade rights to border demarcation. By creating a central arbitration authority we can greatly reduce these tensions."
 mesoamerican_reform_3: "Central Armories"
 mesoamerican_reform_3_desc: "In times of war it has been customary for the city states of Mesoamerica to arm the commoners in order to raise armies big enough to challenge their neighbors.

By creating a central system of armories from which all armies are equipped we can drastically increase the quality of our armed forces."
 mesoamerican_reform_4: "Tribal Expansion"

 religious_reforms.2.t: "Reform Passed"
 religious_reforms.2.d: "The successful implementation of our recent reforms has resulted in some distress, both among the nobles and among the Huaca-worshippers in the countryside, who feel left behind.

 religious_reforms.3.t: "Reform Passed"

 maya_religion_events.1.d: "Our country has reached an era of turmoil, and the gods demand blood.

 maya_religion_events.1.b: "The gods will get no blood from me!"
 maya_religion_events.2.t: "Blood Sacrifice"
 maya_religion_events.2.d: "Human energy is sent skyward and we receive divine power in return when we make a blood sacrifice. The king uses an obsidian knife or a stingray spine to cut his penis, allowing the blood to fall onto paper held in bowls. The queen pulls a rope with thorns attached through her tongue. The paper stained with blood is burned and the rising smoke communicates with the Sky World."

 maya_religion_events.2.b: "I will never do this."
 maya_religion_events.3.t: "Human Sacrifice"
 maya_religion_events.3.d: "Slaves and prisoners are a common sacrifice to the Mayan gods, but even animals such as turkeys, dogs, squirrels, quail, and iguana have been considered suitable offerings.

 maya_religion_events.3.a: "Try sacrificing animals."
 maya_religion_events.3.b: "Sacrifice children - as long as they are parentless."
 maya_religion_events.4.t: "Cycle of Creation and Destruction"
 maya_religion_events.4.d: "Our stories and myths tell of repeating cycles of creation and destruction which are reminders of the consequences that will happen if humans ever neglect their obligations to the gods. We have a responsibility to the gods who make our continued existence possible. The gods and other forces of creation and chaos fight each 52-year period which may bring the destruction of the worlds. If we ignore our duty to the gods, the battle between them that determines the fate of all earthly creatures might not end in our favor."

 maya_religion_events.5.t: "Purification"
 maya_religion_events.5.d: "'A ritual shall always start with a purification,' the priest says to your heir. 'You become pure by fasting, bathing, and confessing, but you must also make sure to respect the gods.

The water must be spat on the ground and then you are free to continue into the sacred forest.'"

 maya_religion_events.6.d: "The Q'eqchi' thirteen sacred mountains, the large cenote in Chichen Itza and local shrines to various gods and goddesses attracts a lot of pilgrims, who need shelter, food and other necessary supplies. To allow them to visit our local shrines would bring us prestige and perhaps some other incomes..."
 maya_religion_events.6.a: "Encourage pilgrims."
 maya_religion_events.6.b: "Do nothing."
 maya_religion_events.7.t: "Aluxob"
 maya_religion_events.7.d: "A farmer has managed to set an alux free, neglecting to seal it inside his house after seven years has passed since it was built. This has led to people complaining about missing items, lost animals and smaller injuries caused by the alux."

That severed head was their father, who together with his brother was summoned to Xibalba after their ball game had disturbed the peace of the Lords of the Underworld. The twins had many adventures before they themselves were summoned to Xibalba as their ball game disturbed the lords once again. The dream was about the many trials the twins faced before they reached the Lords of the Underground, and how they managed to defeat the lords. The dream ended when the twins transformed into the sun and moon which is a sign that a new age is beginning."

 maya_religion_events.12.t: "Sacrificial Traditions"
 maya_religion_events.12.d: "It is time to decide how we should sacrifice the human offerings and there are several different ways to choose from. Decapitation, heart extraction, arrow sacrifice, disembowelment or throwing the offering into a cenote. What should we choose? The decapitation of the offering is done in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the Maya death gods, while the heart extraction is inspired by the Aztecs. The heart is pulled out while it is still beating, blood smeared upon the image of the temple's deity and the corpse skinned. The arrow sacrifice begins with the offering being painted blue with a white symbol over its chest, then bound to a stake during a ritual dance while wearing a peaked cap. Blood is drawn and smeared upon the deity's image and the dancers then takes turn shooting arrows at the offering until its whole chest is filled with arrows. Disembowelment is a slower death but not as elaborate, a sacrifice is bound to a stake with his hands tied behind his head and then disemboweled. The offerings can also be thrown into our Sacred Cenote."

 maya_religion_events.13.d: "Our country is suffering and our priests have started suggesting that honoring Ixtab would be a good idea. Rope Woman, as she is also called, is the goddess of suicide and will accompany those who die by hanging to paradise. It is an honorable way to die and those who choose it will join people who died as soldiers or as sacrificial victims, women who died in childbirth and members of the priesthood. These enjoy a delectable existence and are rewarded with delicious food and drink. Wouldn't it be preferable to the chaos your country is currently experiencing, to rest instead under the shade of a pleasant tree, free from all want?"

In the unlikely event that the captive should survive the encounter with his first four adversaries he will face one final, left-handed, fighter.

Oral poetry is therefore one of the most sacred forms of art and one of few accepted ways in which a person can express dissatisfaction, anxiety and even doubt about fate itself without angering the gods.\nRecently an immensely popular Nahuatl poet has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], praising our city and its people but criticizing the Tlatoani himself."
 nahuatl_events.28.a: "He pleases the gods and the people."
 nahuatl_events.28.b: "He cannot be allowed to stay."
 nahuatl_events.29.t: "Expansion of the [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] Main Temple"
 nahuatl_events.29.d: "The main temple of our capital is the primary symbol of our rule and the bond we have with the gods. It is where all of the main sacrifices will be made during the many festivals of the year and it is the main target for any invading enemy. For a Tlatoani it is a duty to maintain and expand the temple whenever possible."
 nahuatl_events.29.a: "Undertake an ambitious expansion of the Pyramid."
 nahuatl_events.29.b: "Time to add another layer to the Pyramid."
 nahuatl_events.29.c: "Modest improvements, it's all we can afford."
 nahuatl_events.29.dd: "We cannot afford to do much at this time."
 nahuatl_events.30.t: "Pilgrimage to Cholula"
 nahuatl_events.30.d: "It is traditional for all our nobles to travel to the great shrine of Quetzalcoatl in the temple city of Cholula. Here the benevolent feathered serpent, protector of the arts and rains, can be worshipped and here the nobles of mesoamerica can show of their wealth without having to face each other in combat."
 nahuatl_events.30.a: "Pay homage to Quetzalcoatl."
 nahuatl_events.30.b: "What kind of god does not require human sacrifice?"

 nahuatl_events.31.d: "Each and every citizen of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] awoke at once this morning as a powerful earthquake shook the entire city, destroying several buildings and even some of the temples. To the great relief of commoner and noble alike however the city and most of its inhabitants remain unharmed.\nThe fact that the destruction of the 5th sun and the end of this age will come in the form of massive earthquakes that will destroy all living things is known to even the smallest child. We must thank the gods that have helped us keep this world alive for sparing us today."
 nahuatl_events.31.a: "Praise Tezcatlipoca, god of providence and ruler of the night."

 inti_events.1.d: "With the funeral of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ his transition through mummification begins. Once the funeral rites have been observed the relatives and servants of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ will form a Panaca lineage lead by the deceased ruler and tasked with preserving his memory and handling his affairs. His property and authority will remain what it was during his life and the mummy will continue to be the head of his lineage from now on.\nPanacas of former rulers often remain the most influential groups in high society and it is rare for a new ruler to rise without their support. Not all rulers are fit for mummification however, there are some we would rather forget."
 inti_events.1.a: "$RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$'s Panaca is born."
 inti_events.1.a.tt: "The Mummy takes its place as the head of a new Panaca, taking its property with it."

 inti_events.2.t: "A Suitable Wife for [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 inti_events.2.d: "The priests of Inti have made it clear that [Root.Heir.GetName] must take his sister as his primary wife to please the gods. Many of his ancestors and even the god of the sun himself have married this way within the family and kept the bloodline pure. The boy's mother however refuses to hear of this and will not give her consent.\nThe proper way to solve this schism would be to ask our ancestor, the mummy that is the head of our Panaca lineage for guidance."
 inti_events.2.a: "Consult our ancestor."
 inti_events.2.b: "Give in to his Mother."
 inti_events.2.c: "Disregard the Mother outright."
 inti_events.3.t: "Mallqui Approval"
 inti_events.3.d: "Through the priests of the Panaca, the Mummy at the head of our lineage has made it known that he approves of the proposed marriage. As his authority is supreme there is really no way now for anyone to object to the proposed marriage of [Root.Heir.GetName] to his sister."
 inti_events.3.a: "Then married they shall be."
 inti_events.3.b: "On second thought, perhaps holding off is for the best."
 inti_events.4.t: "Mallqui Disapproval"
 inti_events.4.d: "Through the priests of the Panaca, the Mummy at the head of our lineage has made it known that he does not approve of the proposed marriage. As his authority is supreme there is really no way now to carry through with the marriage."
 inti_events.4.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.5.t: "Chief conspiring against [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 inti_events.5.d: "Our religious inspector has uncovered a conspiracy where one of the minor chiefs of the realm has been conspiring against the health of [Root.Monarch.GetName] through a golden Huaca god.\nWhile it is doubtful if there was ever any real risk for [Root.Monarch.GetName] the inspector is proposing that we make an example of this chief, and proclaim him the worst kind of traitor as well as forcibly removing the Huaca that was involved."
 inti_events.5.a: "Removing the Huaca is enough."
 inti_events.5.b: "This chief will face the Sankacancha pit."
 inti_events.5.b.tt: "The chief is executed and a loyal servant is appointed to rule the area until the situation stabilizes."
 inti_events.5.c: "Reprimand the Chief but let him live."
 inti_events.6.t: "Veneration of Local Huaca"
 inti_events.6.d: "A ruler is expected to travel around his kingdom, inspecting each and every part of his realm and partaking in the religious as well as worldly ceremonies of his chiefs. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the huge temple of a local Huaca god, a mummy of dynasty long gone, the royal priests urge caution. This is an unusually popular Huaca and if we are seen to honor the Huacas of our subjects too clearly we would be giving them too much power and authority.\nOn the other hand this Huaca is said to be very powerful and its popularity along with the favors it might provide are very enticing."
 inti_events.6.a: "Honor the Huaca."
 inti_events.6.b: "Avoid visiting the Temple."
 inti_events.6.c: "Force the chief to send the Huaca to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.7.t: "The Young Men and Women of [Root.GetName]"
 inti_events.7.d: "The priests of [Root.GetName] are concerned about too many of the young men and women in the area remaining unmarried. It seems events have conspired to make it hard to make good social and economical matches here and the families in the area are reluctant agree to any proposed match. It is not unheard of for a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to step in and forcibly arrange marriages in times such as these. Perhaps it is time for [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to step in?"
 inti_events.7.a: "Send a priest to arrange suitable matches."
 inti_events.7.b: "It is not for us to meddle in these things."
 inti_events.8.t: "Shrine of Viracocha"
 inti_events.8.d: "After having created the world and given each ethnic group their language and clothes, Viracocha travelled from lake Titicaca through the Andes disguised as an old man. As he wasn't recognized as a deity he was badly treated and in order to demonstrate his identity he eventually burned the earth and forced the people to recognize his power.\nToday the route from lake Titicaca is dotted with the shrines of the great god and Kacha, where he forced the people to recognize him, would be an ideal location for a temple to the great creator."
 inti_events.8.a: "We must build such a temple."
 inti_events.8.b: "Let's focus our resources on other things."
 inti_events.9.t: "Aucachic Confessors"
 inti_events.9.d: "After a recent war guilt lies like a heavy blanket over our people. It is time to give them the opportunity to purify themselves frp, the sins they have had to commit in times of war. Our priests have signaled that this would be an opportune time to hold a festival of purification and fasting so that anyone could confess to the Aucachics and be cleansed in the streams of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.9.a: "Sounds like a good idea."
 inti_events.9.b: "Let's not."
 inti_events.10.t: "Great Temple of [Root.GetName]"
 inti_events.10.d: "Word has reached us that a local chief in [Root.GetName] has begun to construct an ambitious new temple for the main Huaca God of his tribe. As is often the case this Huaca also happens to be a mummified ancestor of his own lineage. While the chief seems content to acknowledge our authority it is hard to shake the notion that he is attempting to build a bigger power base for himself in [Root.GetName].\nThe priests of Inti in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] strongly advocate that we remove the Huaca to put this chief in his place."
 inti_events.10.a: "Order the chief to turn over his Huaca."
 inti_events.10.b: "Allow the temple to be built."
 inti_events.11.t: "Reciprocity"
 inti_events.11.d: "Nothing comes for free in this world. While any of the many chiefs in our realm would immediately profess to be our loyal servant if asked we can be sure that loyalty comes with a price. Unless we regularly hold great feasts for the chiefs of our realm and see to it that they are rewarded with gifts for their many services to us, we might well find they lack the motivation to do even the simplest of tasks for us."
 inti_events.11.a: "Let us hold a lavish feast."
 inti_events.11.b: "We cannot afford more than a moderate feast."
 inti_events.11.c: "I can see no need for such extravagance."
 inti_events.12.t: "Festival of Water"
 inti_events.12.d: "Without rivers and streams life in the Andes would be much harder and the spirits that animate the running water are certainly worthy of our appreciation. The time has come for the festival of Purapucyo. The strong streams of the Andes are ready to receive our gifts."
 inti_events.12.a: "A sacrifice of Chicha Beer to drink."
 inti_events.12.b: "A sacrifice of Llamas to ease their burdens."
 inti_events.12.c: "A sacrifice of fine Cloth to keep them warm."
 inti_events.13.t: "Construction of a Temple"
 inti_events.13.d: "The people of the province of [Root.GetName] are divided and worship various local Huaca Gods. It has therefore been decided that a great temple of Inti should be constructed here as a natural centre for the spiritual and administrative life of the region.\nThe leader of the construction has presented [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] with two different plans for the temple. The first plan is to construct the temple at a Tincuy, the sacred confluence of two streams, while the other plan calls for making use of an old Huaca shrine as the base of the new temple."
 inti_events.13.a: "A new temple needs a new location, the Tincuy it is."
 inti_events.13.b: "Let's make use of the old shrine."
 inti_events.14.t: "Oracles and Divination"
 inti_events.14.d: "The world can sometimes be an unforgiving place and fate may turn in surprising ways. Luckily we have the Huaca Gods of our people to help us interpret what the future holds. Should the future be too hard for the Huacas to penetrate there are other oracles in the Andes, but they require a worthy gift before sharing their visions. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by ample doubts recently and it is perhaps time to consult the auguries."
 inti_events.14.a: "Consult the oracle of our local Huaca at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.14.b: "Travel to the great Oracle of Pachacamac."
 inti_events.14.c: "We must go to the Oracle of Apurímac."
 inti_events.14.dd: "Best not to dwell on the future."
 inti_events.15.t: "Favorable answer from the Huatuc & Hamurpa"
 inti_events.15.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. The Guacarimachic speak to Huacas while the Ayatapuc communicate with the dead. The Huatuc achieves a prophetic mood using a holy beverage while the Hamurpa read the entrails of sacrificed Llamas or other animals.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose and all agree that the time ahead will be a most fruitful and successful one."
 inti_events.15.a: "Excellent."
 inti_events.16.t: "Conflicted answer of the Huatuc & Hamurpa"
 inti_events.16.d: "A great number of diviners are attached to any given Oracle's shrine. The Guacarimachic speak to Huacas while the Ayatapuc communicate with the dead. The Huatuc achieves a prophetic mood using a holy beverage while the Hamurpa read the entrails of sacrificed Llamas or other animals.\nAll of these great diviners have now dwelt on the questions [Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to pose but the answer is not as favorable as he would have hoped. The signs are conflicted and as far as can be discerned the future holds both risks and opportunities for us."
 inti_events.16.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.17.t: "Mitmaq Wanting to Go Home"
 inti_events.17.d: "With the conquest of new lands we have come across groups of people that have been forcibly moved as Mitmaq from one region to another by their former overlords. As Mitmaq are not allowed to change the way they speak, the clothes they wear and have to take all their property with them, these people have never stopped to yearn for their original homes.\nAs it happens their area of origin is also under our control and a delegation from the Mitmaq has therefore been sent before [Root.Monarch.GetName] claiming that their Huacas have told them to return, begging us to lift their obligations."
 inti_events.17.a: "Allow the Mitmaq to Return."
 inti_events.17.b: "They are needed where they are."
 inti_events.18.t: "Priests Inciting Unrest in [Root.GetName]"
 inti_events.18.d: "The priests of a minor Huaca god in [Root.GetName] have been trying to inflame opinions against our rule by saying that we are slowly attempting to increase the authority of Inti and marginalize that of all the Huaca Gods. Luckily most of our subjects know better than to listen to these wild accusations but one of [Root.GetName]'s tribes supports the priests and have now demanded that we give them guarantees for the safety of their Gods and their people."
 inti_events.18.a: "The time has come for these people to move on, as Mitmaq."
 inti_events.18.b: "Give guarantees to the local priests."
 inti_events.18.c: "These priests are only fit for the Sankacancha pit."
 inti_events.19.t: "Growth of [Root.GetName]"
 inti_events.19.d: "The state policy to arrange marriages in [Root.GetName] has paid off. Not only has the worrying trend receded, the population has in fact sharply increased as a result of our meddling.\nWhile the increase of the workforce benefits the province in general however the feelings of resentment from the families forced to make suboptimal matches remain."
 inti_events.19.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.20.t: "Inti Raymi, the Festival of the Sun"
 inti_events.20.d: "The Yañca priests, in charge of monitoring the sun, have proclaimed that the most opportune time to celebrate the Inti Raymi festival is almost upon us. The festival which lasts several days typically involves the entire population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as well as important chiefs from the countryside and some of their minor Huaca Gods."
 inti_events.20.a: "The population of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] will participate."
 inti_events.20.b: "Call upon all of the important Chiefs of the Empire."
 inti_events.20.c: "All chiefs and all Huaca gods must attend the ceremony."
 inti_events.21.t: "Insubordinate Chiefs"
 inti_events.21.d: "Some of the chiefs that have been called have taken offense to being ordered around and have refused to join the Inti Raymi festival."
 inti_events.21.a: "Bribe them with expensive goods and promises."
 inti_events.21.b: "We will have to make do."
 inti_events.21.c: "If they do not come willingly we will force them."
 inti_events.22.t: "Huacas Kept"
 inti_events.22.d: "Priests in charge of some of the Huaca Gods have taken offense to being ordered to move their deity to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are refusing to come."

 inti_events.22.b: "Force them to comply."

 inti_events.25.t: "Celebration of Inti Raymi"
 inti_events.25.d: "After several days of fasting and abstinence the time has come for the festival of the sun.

 inti_events.28.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.29.t: "Itu Celebration"
 inti_events.29.d: "There is great distress in our lands. People are suffering and many fear for the future. In times like these an Itu celebration for the entire kingdom might lighten the minds of our subjects. The sacrifices it entails will also make the Gods more listen to our plights.\nFor this festival our priests are urging that we undertake a human sacrifice as the plight of our people have been great and they feel a grand ceremony is necessary to placate the gods."
 inti_events.29.a: "Let us stick with the customary sacrifices."
 inti_events.29.a.tt: "Hold a customary festival with sacrifices of Llamas, Cloth, Sheep and Chicha."
 inti_events.29.b: "Human Sacrifice it is."

 inti_events.29.c: "We must focus on the here and now."
 inti_events.30.t: "Celebration of the Itu"
 inti_events.30.d: "After days of celebration the future certainly looks brighter. Grand ceremonial dancing ceremonies in the public squares of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], feasts for all vassal chiefs and ample sacrifices of animals, cloth and Chicha beer to the gods will ensure that the Gods look more favorably on our realm in the future."
 inti_events.30.a: "Ok."

 inti_events.31.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.32.t: "The Royal Guards"
 inti_events.32.d: "The honor to guard the life of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is hereditary and belongs to a number of families in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This honor is in itself not a guarantee of martial prowess however. After a tour in the provinces it is clear to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the quality of the guard could be dramatically improved if we brought in some new blood from the countryside.\nThis would however not be well received by the families currently given the privilege, at least not until the new members have been integrated for a few generations."
 inti_events.32.a: "Bring in new blood."
 inti_events.32.b: "Let them keep their privilege."
 inti_events.33.t: "Alarmed Nobles"
 inti_events.33.d: "A delegation from some of the finest families in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] demanding that the new members of the royal guard be sent back to their homes in the provinces. While they are pleased that the institution as such was not changed they are abhorred by the kind of people that now have the hereditary right to guard the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. These men are not fit to be part of the high aristocracy of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.33.a: "Revert the decision to expand the Guard."
 inti_events.33.b: "Give it a generation or two."

 inti_events.34.d: "During the customary serving of beverages to the commoners from around the royal litter in the squares of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] today [Root.Monarch.GetName] was attacked by a small group of would-be assassins. The group suddenly retreated without being anywhere near achieving the goal of hurting [Root.Monarch.GetName], but it was worryingly clear that the royal guards never saw this coming. Perhaps because they are not yet used to the bustling environment of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 inti_events.34.a: "Revert the decision to expand the Guard."
 inti_events.34.b: "This seems a bit too convenient..."
 inti_events.34.b.tt: "Start an investigation into who planned the attack."

 inti_events.35.d: "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] never had much to go on and it has been hard to get people to cooperate, especially among the nobility. While the investigator seems to suspect that this was the work of some discontent sons of the aristocracy we can never know for sure."
 inti_events.35.a: "Ok."
 inti_events.36.t: "Plot Uncovered"
 inti_events.36.d: "The investigation into the attack in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has uncovered an amateurish plot by a group of young nobles from the families that felt marginalized in the royal guard. They claim that the attack was never intended to harm anyone, just point towards the weaknesses of the new additions to the guard. The punishment for treason is clearly death but the nobility of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] would clearly not feel any less threatened if we killed their sons. If we forgive them the transgression perhaps that will be the end of this."
