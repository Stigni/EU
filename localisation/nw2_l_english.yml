A bomb hidden in a barrel loaded on a parked cart exploded just as Napoleon and his escort were passing by on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' The bomb, nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse.
