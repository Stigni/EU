 muslim_piety.12.t:0 "Blasphemy"
 muslim_piety.12.d:0 "A prominent and outspoken government official recently transferred home from the diplomatic corps seems to have spent a little too much of his time abroad. He has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] with some controversial ideas on how to interpret the words of the Prophet, and needless to say, this has provoked a lot of ire amongst the clergy.

 muslim_piety.14.d:0 "The morale of our great army is the envy of all, and the zeal of our soldiers alone is enough to overcome adversities that would send other armies into a mad rout.

 muslim_piety.15.b:0 "Yes, this is for the good of our nation!"
 muslim_piety.16.t:0 "Rampant Corruption"
 muslim_piety.16.d:0 "As our government becomes more secular, a new breed of pragmatism seems to have taken root in our officials and administrators. Unfortunately, the new climate has encouraged rampant corruption as well, with everyone concerned only about looking out for themselves. Many have called out for a return to the old ways, when our nation truly followed the path the Prophet had laid out for us."

 EVTNAME5075:0 "Nobles Demand Old Rights"

 EVTNAME5076:0 "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 EVTDESC5076:0 "Urban dwellers had always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren - even in the same state.

 EVTOPTB5076:0 "Accept"
 EVTNAME5077:0 "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"

 EVTNAME5082:0 "Bourgeoisie Request Privileges"
 EVTDESC5082:0 "The Bourgeoisie class has grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government.

 EVTOPTB5084:0 "Decline the offer"
 EVTNAME5085:0 "Build a Great Palace"
 EVTDESC5085:0 "Monarchs were often struggling with ways to subdue the nobility. The rise of firearms reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. Some monarchs created great new palaces with elaborate court rituals to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied. Versailles is the greatest expression of this movement."
 EVTOPTA5085:0 "Build the palace"
 EVTOPTB5085:0 "Don't build it"
 EVTNAME5086:0 "Uncooperative Philosopher"
 EVTDESC5086:0 "Many times men of ideas would posit ideas that ran counter to accepted doctrine either from the monarch or the Church. The state would normally try to get the thinker to recant his ideas and, failing that, would resort to imprisonment or execution.

 EVTOPTB5087:0 "Settle issue"
 EVTNAME5088:0 "Merchants harassed"
 EVTDESC5088:0 "Disputes over the treatment of local merchants were not uncommon. All governments faced minor reports of unfair treatment and harassment of their merchants.

These issues could be resolved but saber rattling was always an option."
 EVTOPTA5088:0 "Escalate complaint"
 EVTOPTB5088:0 "Seek a diplomatic solution"
 EVTNAME5089:0 "Petition for Redress"
 EVTDESC5089:0 "Peasants typically had no voice but they could occasionally gain access to the monarch and ask for redress. Sometimes, these requests for redress would be directed at the local lord who was perceived to be violating the peasants' rights. Stepping in to override a noble's local authority was a very drastic step."

 EVTOPTB5089:0 "Deny petition"
 EVTNAME5090:0 "Noble Family Requests Aid"
 EVTDESC5090:0 "The most powerful of the noble families in the state often had vast wealth but that did not stop them, like their monarchs, from getting into financial troubles.

The monarchs were often receptive since they would usually be related by blood or marriage."

 EVTOPTB5090:0 "Deny aid"
 EVTNAME5091:0 "Support for Dissidents Abroad"
 EVTDESC5091:0 "We have been contacted by a variety of dissidents from other states. These dissidents claim to have vast supporters who just need some cash - they are most likely lying.

 EVTOPTB5091:0 "Decline"
 EVTNAME5092:0 "Foreign Trade Competition Rises"
 EVTDESC5092:0 "Trade was heavily regulated during this era but despite this the markets were not fixed. At times merchants would try to enter new markets or sell new goods. Merchants facing these conditions would usually demand new or higher tariffs to stop their competitors."

 EVTOPTB5093:0 "We have faith in them"
 EVTNAME5094:0 "Heretic Advisor"

 EVTNAME9042:0 "Unruly Daimyo"
 EVTDESC9042:0 "Several local Daimyo swearing fealty to our realm have been conspiring against us for some time.

 EVTOPTB9042:0 "Hang them high"
 EVTNAME9044:0 "Koku Reform"
 EVTDESC9044:0 "The wealth of our lands is measured in 'Koku', with one Koku being the volume of rice required to feed one person for a year. While this is fairly easy to measure as such, several of the Provinces within our Domain have been consistently misvalued, since the Koku records have not been updated for several years. The outdated records, used among other things for tax collections, are becoming a source of growing discontent within our realm."

 EVTNAME9046:0 "Rangaku Books"
 EVTDESC9046:0 "A European trader trafficking the waters around Japan has landed in our Han and offered to sell us a collection of treatises on western medicine, politics and astronomy. Buying these books would doubtless mean a shift in policy with regard to our Han's openness to trade, and such subversive tomes could destabilize the realm. Not buying the books might be a missed opportunity, but it will on the other hand force us to learn and discover for ourselves."

 EVTDESC11000:0 "A Eunuch who claims to hail from a northern border province has offered his services to the Imperial Court. The man is clearly of some talent, and can most likely be a boon to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration.

 EVTNAME11002:0 "Eunuch Schemes for Influence"

 EVTNAME11004:0 "Eunuchs Isolate The Emperor"
 EVTDESC11004:0 "The Eunuch faction has advanced its positions within the Imperial court.

 EVTNAME11006:0 "A Grave for a Eunuch"
 EVTDESC11006:0 "A powerful Eunuch within the Imperial Court has died due to old age. The death of this powerful eminence has left a power vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill. While the Eunuch faction will be weakened from this loss, we could soften the blow by providing the man with a stately funeral, as a token of our appreciation."
 EVTOPTA11006:0 "The state has no money to spend"
 EVTOPTB11006:0 "Naturally we wish to aid those in need"
 EVTNAME11008:0 "The Yellow River Trade"
 EVTDESC11008:0 "The Yellow River trade in rice and silver has been flourishing over the past few years, but officials from the provinces are complaining that more and more wealth from the countryside is being washed away to the coastal cities with every flood.

 EVTOPTB11010:0 "It really is too much!"
 EVTNAME11012:0 "Destitute Banknotes"
 EVTDESC11012:0 "Inflation is becoming more and more of a problem in $COUNTRY$, as more and more unbacked notes are issued by the Central Government. One of our courtiers from the Eunuch faction has proposed a scheme to reinvigorate the country's economy by means of a temporary tax combined with reforms to the Treasury. While you have some doubts about the validity of his ideas, the money that the scheme promises to bring in could be put to good use."
 EVTOPTA11012:0 "This all sounds very interesting!"
 EVTOPTB11012:0 "Only hard work can reform the currency"
 EVTNAME11014:0 "Quick-fingered Eunuch"
 EVTDESC11014:0 "Money has been mysteriously disappearing from the Imperial treasury for some time now, and you have started to direct your suspicions to a court Eunuch employed as a treasury book keeper."
 EVTOPTA11014:0 "Execute him!"
 EVTOPTB11014:0 "Best to keep quiet about this"
 EVTNAME11016:0 "Eunuch Excels at Examinations"
 EVTDESC11016:0 "A young courtier associated with the Eunuch faction in palace politics has excelled at this year's Imperial Examinations. The rise of young talent within the Eunuch faction is bound to strengthen the faction, unless we take steps and measures to prevent that."
 EVTOPTA11016:0 "This man must be granted a place in court!"
 EVTOPTB11016:0 "I'm sure he can find work in the provinces"
 EVTNAME11018:0 "The Eunuch's Vice"
 EVTDESC11018:0 "One of the influential members of the Eunuch faction harbors a dark secret. For some time, the young courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction. The Eunuch has requested that the matter be kept under a lid, and promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."

 EVTNAME11100:0 "The Examinations of $YEAR$"
 EVTDESC11100:0 "Pupils and Examinees associated with the Bureaucrat faction have outperformed themselves and most everyone else at this year's Imperial Examination.

 EVTOPTA11100:0 "Put them to work in the provinces"
 EVTOPTB11100:0 "Use them to reform the administration"
 EVTNAME11102:0 "A Jade Seal"
 EVTDESC11102:0 "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Jade seal of some level of craftsmanship. The gift has been presented by an up and coming administrator associated with the Bureaucrat faction. As nothing is free in The Middle Kingdom, he probably expects us to return the favor."
 EVTOPTA11102:0 "He expects too much"
 EVTOPTB11102:0 "Naturally we accept the gift!"
 EVTNAME11104:0 "The $PROVINCENAME$ Levy"
 EVTDESC11104:0 "Officials from the Bureaucrat faction have undertaken a project to expand the levy in $PROVINCENAME$ by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the Imperial Army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. Not carrying out these reforms means weakening the Bureaucrat faction, and will also leave the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ free to produce other things of value."
 EVTOPTA11104:0 "Naturally these reforms are called for"
 EVTOPTB11104:0 "No need to harass the peasantry"
 EVTNAME11106:0 "Field Marshal Dishonored"
 EVTDESC11106:0 "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for the northern defenses. The Field Marshal is associated with the Palatial Bureaucrat Faction, and the disgrace he has brought to himself is bound to reflect negatively on the faction."
 EVTOPTA11106:0 "Execute him!"
 EVTOPTB11106:0 "Forgive him"
 EVTNAME11108:0 "Heir Lends an Ear"
 EVTDESC11108:0 "We have noticed that our heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and officials who are known affiliates of the Bureaucrat faction. It appears that your heir sympathizes with the Bureaucrat faction and its political position. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our young heir when he assumes the throne."
 EVTOPTA11108:0 "Leave your heir be"
 EVTOPTB11108:0 "Stop the Bureaucrats"
 EVTNAME11110:0 "Confucian Wisdom"
 EVTDESC11110:0 "One of the Imperial Courtiers affiliated with the Bureaucrat faction has developed a reputation as quite the scholar. The man is specialized in the writings of Confucius, and it is said that he is capable of reciting broad parts of the Confucian corpus by heart. A scholar of such erudition brings influence and power to his faction."
 EVTOPTA11110:0 "Converse with the scholar"
 EVTOPTB11110:0 "Put the man to work"
 EVTNAME11112:0 "Literati Publishes"
 EVTDESC11112:0 "A scholar affiliated with the Bureaucrat faction has published a novel that has been hailed by commentators as one of the greatest achievements of contemporary literature. The publication of such an important work increases the standing of both the writer and his faction."
 EVTOPTA11112:0 "He is a credit to his nation"
 EVTOPTB11112:0 "I didn't think it was that good"
 EVTNAME11114:0 "Retainer Flogged"
 EVTDESC11114:0 "One of the big names within the Bureaucrat faction has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste. While the Bureaucrat is fully within his rights to punish his lessers, people generally feel that his treatment could benefit from a little moderation."
 EVTOPTA11114:0 "He's setting an excellent example!"
 EVTOPTB11114:0 "Tell him to control himself"
 EVTNAME11116:0 "Drama on The Pearl River"
 EVTDESC11116:0 "A Pearl River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the southern provinces, has been boarded and seized by pirates. The official responsible for maintaining security on the relevant section of the river, a young courtier from the Bureaucrat faction, has suffered a nervous breakdown after hearing about the incident and is reportedly locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
 EVTOPTA11116:0 "I guess we can kiss those taxes goodbye"
 EVTOPTB11116:0 "Levy extra taxes to remedy the situation"
 EVTNAME11118:0 "Gold Mine Discovered"
 EVTDESC11118:0 "A gold mine has been discovered in one of our provinces, and the man in charge of the prospecting that went into finding it is reportedly a young official affiliated with the Bureaucrat faction. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
 EVTOPTA11118:0 "Dig deep and greedily!"
 EVTOPTB11118:0 "Let sleeping dogs lie"
 EVTNAME11120:0 "Bullion Leaves the Country"
 EVTDESC11120:0 "Large amounts of silver bullion have left the country on various trade barges sailing from our many ports. Officials in the Bureaucrat faction are being blamed for the development, as their statist trade policy is believed to be causing the exodus of wealth."
 EVTOPTA11120:0 "Expensive!"
 EVTOPTB11120:0 "Mint more to make up for the losses"
 EVTNAME11122:0 "Renovating a Pagoda"
 EVTDESC11122:0 "A Tang dynasty pagoda in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance, and now a local official has requested funds to restore the pagoda. The official in question is related to the Bureaucrat faction, so any money spent on the pagoda will also be money spent on the Bureaucrats."
 EVTOPTA11122:0 "Naturally we shall restore it"
 EVTOPTB11122:0 "We have no time for such nonsense"
 EVTNAME11200:0 "The Buddha's Smile"
 EVTDESC11200:0 "The writings of Master Confucius are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing the Buddhist rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Temple faction, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Confucianism. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."
 EVTOPTA11200:0 "They may believe what they wish"
 EVTOPTB11200:0 "Dispatch officials immediately"
 EVTNAME11202:0 "Crack-down on Heresy"
 EVTDESC11202:0 "The Temple faction has taken matters into its own hands in $PROVINCENAME$ recently, where religious heresies have previously been known to ferment. The Temple faction has been quite active in the area, spreading the word of Master Confucius. If we allow the Temple faction to continue working in the province, it is likely that the local religious affiliation will change."
 EVTOPTA11202:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTOPTB11202:0 "Leave those poor locals be"
 EVTNAME11204:0 "Temple Faction Diplomacy"
 EVTDESC11204:0 "Officials from the Temple faction have been very active in the foreign diplomacy of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Court lately. One foreign power in particular occupies the faction's attention, and the Faction feels that this foreign power should submit to the authority of The Middle Kingdom. The foreign ambassador has been summoned to the imperial palace, what shall we tell him?"
 EVTOPTA11204:0 "That he may go in peace"
 EVTOPTB11204:0 "That he best prepare his defenses"
 EVTNAME11206:0 "Bound Feet"
 EVTDESC11206:0 "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Temple faction is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."
 EVTOPTA11206:0 "Everyone must follow this example!"
 EVTOPTB11206:0 "This sounds a bit over the top"
 EVTNAME11208:0 "Imperial Insults"
 EVTDESC11208:0 "A young courtier of the Temple faction, employed in the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder today, when he, contrary to protocol, bowed two times rather than three when greeting a foreign diplomat. This major loss of face for the courtier has quickly developed into a loss of face for the entire Temple faction!"
 EVTOPTA11208:0 "Apologize to the foreigner"
 EVTOPTB11208:0 "Behead the courtier"
 EVTNAME11210:0 "Inspecting The Banners"
 EVTDESC11210:0 "The armies have amassed on the exercise field for the Grand Army Inspection of $YEAR$. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present, many of who are from the Temple faction, which, for the past few years, has done everything in its power to strengthen its position within the army."
 EVTOPTA11210:0 "Commend the generals for their work"
 EVTOPTB11210:0 "You call this an army!?"
 EVTNAME11212:0 "Temple Conspiracy"
 EVTDESC11212:0 "A conspiracy has formed within the ranks of the socially conservative Temple faction, which has begun maneuvering to make the Temple faction dominant within palace politics. By promoting their own candidates at Imperial Examinations the Temple has begun an ascension to power which is quite remarkable. How should we deal with the Temple's conspiracies?"
 EVTOPTA11212:0 "Nothing. It is merely politics"
 EVTOPTB11212:0 "Behead a few big-wigs"
 EVTNAME11214:0 "Examining the Examinations"
 EVTDESC11214:0 "An official from the Eunuch faction has published a document detailing his criticisms of alleged biases and flaws in the present processes of Imperial Examinations. The official has included a short list of suggestions of simple changes that, in his opinion, would vastly improve the quality of the process. The suggestions fly in the collective face of the Temple faction, which has vigorously defended the Examinations against any and all new-fangled ideas."
 EVTOPTA11214:0 "Change we can believe in!"
 EVTOPTB11214:0 "The Temple has the right idea!"
 EVTNAME11216:0 "A Gift From the Temple"
 EVTDESC11216:0 "A high magistrate affiliated with the Temple faction has presented your Majesty with a most exquisite gift: A copy of the Confucian classic 'The Book of Rites' dated to the late Tang dynasty. The gift echoes the political debate within the Palace, where the Temple faction usually argues in favor of Confucian orthodoxy."
 EVTOPTA11216:0 "Study the book closely"
 EVTOPTB11216:0 "Silly books. Change!"
 EVTNAME11218:0 "Records of the Grand Historian"
 EVTDESC11218:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$, You have reigned for some time now, and many consider it time to compile another grand edition of the 'Records of the Grand Historian'. The Grand Historian himself is affiliated with the Temple faction. Compiling a tome detailing the fortunes of China during your reign would cost a fair bit of money, and give prestige to the Temple faction, but the benefits might outweigh the costs. Shall we put the historian to work?"
 EVTOPTA11218:0 "Yes!"
 EVTOPTB11218:0 "No!"
 EVTNAME11220:0 "A Tibetan Monk"
 EVTDESC11220:0 "A traveler from Tibet has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Lhasa, and that he comes to spread the word of the Buddha. The Temple faction opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Confucius as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people. While there is a case to be made for the Temple Faction's position, overly heavy-handed treatment of Buddhism will destabilize our country."
 EVTOPTA11220:0 "Of course he is free to preach"
 EVTOPTB11220:0 "We should weed out this pest!"
 EVTNAME11222:0 "Burning of Books"
 EVTDESC11222:0 "The Temple faction has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Temple faction holds that only a return to true Confucian values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"
 EVTOPTA11222:0 "That does sound like an idea!"
 EVTOPTB11222:0 "Some other time, perhaps"
 EVTNAME11224:0 "Burying of Scholars"
 EVTDESC11224:0 "The Temple faction, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in China in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands. In several provinces all over the country several prominent scholars of other schools than the official Confucian doctrine have been buried alive. That this will be a blow to innovation is already clear, but how shall we punish the Temple?"
 EVTOPTA11224:0 "Forgive and forget!"
 EVTOPTB11224:0 "Repay them in kind"
 EVTNAME11226:0 "Jin Era Statuette"
 EVTDESC11226:0 "A rare statuette from the Jin era has been discovered during renovations of an old temple. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Emperor. Faction loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Emperor's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"

 EVTNAME11228:0 "The Classic of Music"
 EVTDESC11228:0 "Apart from the five classic texts compiled by Confucius, tradition also speaks of a sixth Classic: The Classic of Music. One of the 305 songs originally contained in this work, which has been lost since 'The Burning of Books' has been rediscovered during an inventory of an old library in one of the Southern provinces. The claim to this marvelous discovery undoubtedly belongs partly to the Head Librarian, associated with the Eunuch faction, but two other candidates also claim to have had part in the discovery. Who do we credit?"
 EVTOPTA11228:0 "The Province Governor"
 EVTOPTB11228:0 "A Local Literati"
 EVTNAME11230:0 "Cheating at Examinations"
 EVTDESC11230:0 "Several examinees have been caught cheating at the Imperial Examinations this year. Instead of the prescribed three day solitude, the examinees have had ready access to the outside world. The cheating was discovered when several disallowed manuscripts were found in the examinees' rooms. The cheating appears systematic and supported by corrupt examinators. Three primary suspects have been identified. Who do we blame?"
 EVTOPTA11230:0 "The Head Examinator"
 EVTOPTB11230:0 "A Court Eunuch"
 EVTOPTC11230:0 "A Scholar at the Examination Center"
 EVTNAME11232:0 "Withdrawing Excess Paper"
 EVTDESC11232:0 "There is general consensus within the Imperial Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is a number much too great for the good of the state finances. That money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level goes without saying, but the question is how much money should be rebought. The factions have their varying solutions, and your Majesty is free to choose one of them."

 EVTOPTC11232:0 "The Temple Solution"
 EVTNAME11234:0 "Honoring the Ancestors"
 EVTDESC11234:0 "The teachings of Confucius stress the importance of understanding and respecting the 'Five Relationships' that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
 EVTOPTA11234:0 "Red meat, to keep them fed"
 EVTOPTB11234:0 "Candles, to light their way"
 EVTOPTC11234:0 "Spirit money, to pay their dues"
 EVTNAME11236:0 "Bad Feng Shui"
 EVTDESC11236:0 "Feng Shui is a system of both aesthetics and 'magic' believed by many to control the flow of the primary energy, the 'Qi', by relying on the laws of Heaven and Earth which guide it. The system is applied to tombs, homes and building, to ensure that the energy that courses through them is optimal. One of the court's most respected diviners and interpreters of the ebb and flow of The Qi has recently discovered that the newly built Imperial Teahouse reeks with negative Qi! Who is responsible for this?"
 EVTOPTA11236:0 "The diviner himself, he's clearly gone mad"
 EVTOPTB11236:0 "The builder, he did not consult the diviners"
 EVTOPTC11236:0 "Whoever put me up to building it"
 EVTNAME11238:0 "Court Bickering"
 EVTDESC11238:0 "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking official from the Bureaucrat faction. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless the matter has become a pivot point of factional politics at the court, and it might be wise if The Emperor himself gave some input on the issue."
 EVTOPTA11238:0 "The Marshal needs to stop complaining"
 EVTOPTB11238:0 "The Official needs to apologize"
 EVTOPTC11238:0 "The Emperor needs a vacation"
 EVTNAME11240:0 "The Necropolis of $MONARCH$"
 EVTDESC11240:0 "$MONARCHTITLE$, there comes a time in the life of every Celestial Emperor when he must begin to consider his final resting place. In order to ensure a suitable position for yourself in the hereafter, it is of the utmost importance that you pick a worthy and fitting tomb in this life. The various courtiers have their own ideas on what the centerpiece of a new tomb complex should be."
 EVTOPTA11240:0 "Bureaucrats: A scale model of China!"
 EVTOPTB11240:0 "Temples: An army of terracotta soldiers!"
 EVTOPTC11240:0 "Eunuchs: The Yellow River in Mercury!"
 EVTNAME11242:0 "The Gilded Pagoda"
 EVTDESC11242:0 "Wrapped in the reddish gold of a dying sun, and reflecting the blue of the heavens suspended above it, the old Gilded Pagoda has stood since the times of the Tang dynasty, or perhaps even longer still. The silence and darkness within the Pagoda is a stark contrast to the light and reflection outside of. Since Buddhism has become rare, the Pagoda has gone unused, and your courtiers have various suggestions as to what could be done with it."
 EVTOPTA11242:0 "Eunuchs: Melt it down and mint the gold!"

 EVTNAME11300:0 "The Shadow that Stalks the Corridor"
 EVTDESC11300:0 "As you walk through the long corridors of the Palace, you suddenly have a distinct sense of being followed. In the corner of your eye a white-clad man approaches you from behind. You cannot see the dagger, gleaming with malice, but you know it is there, behind you, a mere few yards from your heart. Before you the corridor splits. To your right is the Eunuch quarter, guards and safety, and to your left lies the Bureaucrat quarters. What do you do?"
 EVTOPTA11300:0 "Flee to the Eunuchs!"
 EVTOPTB11300:0 "Flee to the Bureaucrats!"
 EVTOPTC11300:0 "Stand and fight!"
 EVTNAME11302:0 "Bureaucrat Swindles the Treasury"
 EVTDESC11302:0 "A high ranking member of the Bureaucrat faction has been caught siphoning funds out of the Imperial Treasury and into his own pocket. The only punishment that can at all be considered is of course death, but the question of who should replace him is less obvious. There are powerful candidates within both the Eunuch and Temple factions, but the candidates from the Bureaucrat faction are doubtlessly the ones best equipped to handle the job. Who should get the job?"
 EVTOPTA11302:0 "A Eunuch Candidate"
 EVTOPTB11302:0 "A Temple Candidate"

 EVTNAME11304:0 "Brigands on the Silk Road"
 EVTDESC11304:0 "With The Mandate of Heaven lost, things have quickly gone from bad to worse in several provinces across the country, where brigands and highwaymen are becoming ever more of a problem. The problem has been particularly noticeable along what remains of the old 'Silk Road'. The matter was discussed recently at a Grand session of the Imperial Court, and several solutions to the brigand problem were presented. How shall we combat the brigands?"
 EVTOPTA11304:0 "With a large scale military campaign"
 EVTOPTB11304:0 "By setting up local militias"
 EVTOPTC11304:0 "Through prayers and faith"
 EVTNAME11306:0 "Reputation for Cruelty"
 EVTDESC11306:0 "Since losing the Mandate of Heaven, people have begun avoiding you. It did not happen overnight, but progressively, as the months have passed, you have noticed that fewer and fewer people seem to take the time to pay their Emperor the proper respects and courtesies. After some cautious inquiries among trusted retainers you discover the reason: People have begun to fear you. For whatever reason, you have developed a reputation for cruelty. What to do about it?"
 EVTOPTA11306:0 "Embrace the reputation"
 EVTOPTB11306:0 "Initiate a propaganda campaign"
 EVTNAME11308:0 "Portentous Solar Eclipse"
 EVTDESC11308:0 "You can only stare in awe as the glowing white of the sun disappears behind the black disc suspended in the sky, and the world turns to darkness despite it being mid day. A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"

Whatever the truth, many have begun believing that such omens are signs that the Mandate of Heaven has been lost. The event has caused the teachings of the Buddha to gain traction in the area. How shall we respond to these rumors?"

 EVTOPTB11310:0 "With violence, how else?"
 EVTNAME11312:0 "Temple Desecrated"
 EVTDESC11312:0 "As the officials enter the temple in the morning they come upon a chaotic scene. Altars have been overturned, figurines smashed and walls and tapestries defaced. Someone has entered the temple during the dark hours of the night, and committed the most heinous acts of sacrilege. No one knows who is responsible for these crimes, but some say that the incident is proof positive that the Mandate of Heaven is no longer with us. What shall we do about the temple?"

 EVTNAME11314:0 "Plague Strikes The Court"
 EVTDESC11314:0 "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning a Bureaucrat employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before.

A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven. There are three suspects in the murder case, who did it?"

 EVTDESC11318:0 "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black furlike hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is deformed, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Some claim that this disaster proves that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven. Various courtiers are willing to give you advice."

You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that the Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty, and that we need to regain it. His companions are from various factions, who should be punished for the incident?"

The Grand Secretary responsible for the treasury, a Eunuch, claims that the Gold must have been transmuted into lead, and hints that it might be a sign from the heavens that our reign no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven.

 EVTOPTA773:0 "Heads will roll! Hopefully not mine..."
 EVTNAME759:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC759:0 "Since the nine hundreds the Archbishopric of Mainz have held the prestigious title of §WPrimas Germaniae§b - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire... We must take heed and not let our prestige drop to low, or we might find the title slip from our fingers!"
 EVTOPTA759:0 "I see..."
 EVTNAME760:0 "Title of Primas Germaniae Questioned"
 EVTDESC760:0 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, much of the Catholic community seem to have lost their faith in us! there are even rumors that another Archbishopric plans to claim our title as Primas Germaniae!"
 EVTOPTA760:0 "Probably just rumors"
 EVTNAME761:0 "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC761:0 "The title of §WPrimas Germaniae§b - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - was created in the nine hundreds when the Archbishopric of Mainz became the first Archbishopric to receive it.\n\nFor the second-rate power of $FROM$ to hold such a prestigious title seems an affront to the Catholic Church. Perhaps a more worthy candidate can be found?"
 EVTOPTA761:0 "Perhaps... me?"
 EVTOPTB761:0 "Leave it be. For now..."
 EVTOPTC761:0 "A better one could not be found."
 EVTNAME762:0 "Primas Germaniae Lost"
 EVTDESC762:0 "My $MONARCHTITLE$, we have lost the prestigious title of §WPrima Germaniae§b! Due to our low standing in the empire of lately, another Archbishop has gone ahead and claimed the title!"
 EVTOPTA762:0 "Very well, congratulate him..."
 EVTOPTB762:0 "We will not forget this!"
 EVTNAME763:0 "Legatus Natus"
 EVTDESC763:0 "We have long been honored with being the Pope's representative - §WLegatus Natus§b - north of the Alps.\n\nSuch a prestigious title demands a certain level of dignity and we cannot let our prestige or our relations with the Pope drop too low."
 EVTOPTA763:0 "It's all in God's hands."
 EVTNAME764:0 "Title of Legatus Natus Lost"
 EVTDESC764:0 "Our standings in the Empire and with the Pope have declined lately. The Pope no longer seems to have confidence in us upholding our role as his delegate in the empire and has most unfortunately decided to relieve us of the title."
 EVTOPTA764:0 "I guess it was in my hands after all..."
 EVTNAME765:0 "Envoy from the Pope"
 EVTDESC765:0 "Good news! We have been selected by the Pope to hold the prestigious title of §WLegatus Natus§b - his representative north of the Alps - after the former holder fell from grace."
 EVTOPTA765:0 "Is that a crepuscular ray shining in?"
 EVTOPTB765:0 "We must graciously decline."
 EVTDESC6197:0 "Our policy of supporting and expanding the bureaucracy of our nation is really paying off. Every day new officials are trained and set off to glorious new careers in our administration!"
 EVTOPTA6197:0 "Excellent!"
 EVTDESC6198:0 "An empire of this size needs a lot of bureaucrats, perhaps offering a sign up bonus will encourage their numbers to grow?"
 EVTOPTA6198:0 "Whatever it takes"
 EVTOPTB6198:0 "Not right now"
 EVTNAME2036:0 "Religious Turmoil"
 EVTDESC2036:0 "Reports have reached us that the Emperor is planning to march against all Protestant states in the Empire. He is determined to cleanse the Holy Roman lands of all heretics before the end of the year. If we are to stay true to our faith, we'll have to make preparations."
 EVTOPTA2036:0 "Proclaim religious independence"
 EVTOPTB2036:0 "Our allegiance lies with the Emperor"
 EVTNAME6100:0 "Popular Support for our Grand navy"
 EVTDESC6100:0 "Across the land people are supporting our Grand Navy, making contributions towards the defense of our nation. In the shipyards our shipwrights are working ever harder, and people are even volunteering to become sailors! People take pride in our great Navy."
 EVTOPTA6100:0 "That's just fantastic"
 EVTNAME6101:0 "Popular Enthusiasm for our Navy diminishes"
 EVTDESC6101:0 "To be honest our people do not feel that our Navy is so Grand anymore, in fact they just plain don't like it. Press gangs are finding it even harder than usual and even acquiring basic materials is a struggle."
 EVTOPTA6101:0 "This is only a short term problem"
 EVTOPTB6101:0 "This is nothing a little money can't solve"
 EVTNAME6102:0 "Promising Admiral Appears"
 EVTDESC6102:0 "One of our Seahawks has turned out to be much better than we first expected."
 EVTOPTA6102:0 "I knew this was a good idea"
 EVTNAME6103:0 "Aristocrats concerned"
 EVTDESC6103:0 "Our policy of appointing promising commanders regardless of birth is upsetting our aristocrats who find it hard to dine with men who lack breeding. According to our aristocrats it is also upsetting the men under their command, who expect to be led by their betters rather than by someone who is plainly not a gentleman."
 EVTOPTA6103:0 "Let them complain"
 EVTOPTB6103:0 "Well, we can make a few concessions"
 EVTNAME6104:0 "Naval Developments"
 EVTDESC6104:0 "Our use of Superior Seamanship is leading to huge developments in Naval thought. This is just too good to be true."
 EVTOPTA6104:0 "This just can't be bad"
 EVTNAME6105:0 "Naval Hubris"
 EVTDESC6105:0 "Our seamanship is so superior that to be honest complacency is setting in. People are content to rest on their laurels and I am not sure this is what we need right now."
 EVTOPTA6105:0 "Our Navy is the best"
 EVTOPTB6105:0 "We must shake them up a little"
 EVTNAME6106:0 "Improved Blockade Tactics"
 EVTDESC6106:0 "Our use of Naval fighting instruction has allowed us to develop much improved blockade tactics. Although our enemies will eventually counter them, for the moment we will really be able to turn the screw."
 EVTOPTA6106:0 "We might even make some money out of this"
 EVTNAME6107:0 "Slipping Standards"
 EVTDESC6107:0 "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to put up fearsome blockades of enemy coasts, but at the moment our sailors are just getting a bit lazy."
 EVTOPTA6107:0 "Well we can't expect them to operate at peak efficiency all the time"
 EVTOPTB6107:0 "I expect every man to do his duty no matter what"
 EVTNAME6108:0 "Naval Technical Developments"
 EVTDESC6108:0 "Our shipwrights are already excellent, but they are currently undergoing a burst of creativity that is leading to newer technical developments."
 EVTOPTA6108:0 "Who am I to stop them?"
 EVTNAME6109:0 "Concerned Shipwrights"
 EVTDESC6109:0 "For reasons we cannot fathom our shipwrights feel that they are not getting the backing and support for the Naval establishment. However ruling a nation is a lot of work, do we really care about such a minor matter?"
 EVTOPTA6109:0 "Why should I care about people who are so poor they have to work?"
 EVTOPTB6109:0 "Time to upset the Naval Establishment"
 EVTNAME6110:0 "We Rule the Waves"
 EVTDESC6110:0 "Our Glorious Navy is the pride of our Nation and the envy of the world."
 EVTOPTA6110:0 "More Glory for us"
 EVTNAME6111:0 "The Fleet has declined"
 EVTDESC6111:0 "No one can quite understand it. One minute we had a glorious navy that the whole nation took pride in. Now the world laughs at our fleet."
 EVTOPTA6111:0 "The Glory days will return"
 EVTOPTB6111:0 "A little money might sort things out"
 EVTNAME6112:0 "Recruits flock to the standards"
 EVTDESC6112:0 "Our system of national conscripts is proving very successful, the poor, the desperate, even the patriotic are flocking to the colors. The Generals are pleased."
 EVTOPTA6112:0 "Let's get them into the army now"
 EVTOPTB6112:0 "No, we must think long term here"
 EVTNAME6113:0 "People don't want to be conscripted"
 EVTDESC6113:0 "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113:0 "Well I am sure we can slow down recruitment in the short term"
 EVTOPTB6113:0 "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners"
 EVTNAME6114:0 "Isn't our Army Grand?"
 EVTDESC6114:0 "Our Grand Army is so grand that it is marching from one victory to another. Experience from those victories positively impacts recruitment and training of new soldiers."
 EVTOPTA6114:0 "This is fantastic"
 EVTNAME6115:0 "Our Army isn't so grand"
 EVTDESC6115:0 "One minute our army is the envy of the world, next no one has anything good to say about it. We have no idea how our grand army slipped so, but it could end up effecting recruitment."
 EVTOPTA6115:0 "Looks like recruitment will be a little harder"
 EVTOPTB6115:0 "Time to shake up the military establishment"
 EVTNAME6116:0 "Military Improvements"
 EVTDESC6116:0 "Our Officers are experimenting with new ways to drill our, already superbly drilled, army. This seems to be raising the overall level of military thought in our nation."
 EVTOPTA6116:0 "I like military thinkers"
 EVTNAME6117:0 "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117:0 "Our superbly drilled army is in the opinion of our most influential generals invincible. Any recent defeats are down to the weather or the enemy using such unmanly things as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned there is no way to improve on perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117:0 "Invincible, I like the sound of it"
 EVTOPTB6117:0 "I think the truth may upset some people"
 EVTNAME6118:0 "Fortification Effort"
 EVTDESC6118:0 "Our Engineering Corps is currently short of things to do, however they have found a province without any fortifications and have taken upon themselves to sort this out."
 EVTOPTA6118:0 "That is very nice of them"
 EVTNAME6119:0 "Fortification Enhancement"
 EVTDESC6119:0 "Our Engineering Corps has found a minor fortification that could do with some improvements."
 EVTOPTA6119:0 "We must always seek improvements wherever possible"
 EVTNAME6120:0 "Our Engineers are busy"
 EVTDESC6120:0 "Our Engineer Corps is always finding ways to keep themselves occupied. Today they upgraded a fortification in one of our provinces."
 EVTOPTA6120:0 "We are pleased"
 EVTNAME6121:0 "Fortification works"
 EVTDESC6121:0 "Our Engineers have enhanced a fortification making it a substantial barrier to enemy forces."
 EVTOPTA6121:0 "Let's hope someone tries to siege it"
 EVTNAME6122:0 "Epic Fortification built"
 EVTDESC6122:0 "An already substantial fortification has been enhanced by our engineers, although some of our generals feel that our troops are wasted cowering behind forts."
 EVTOPTA6122:0 "One mustn't grumble"
 EVTNAME6123:0 "New Bastions built"
 EVTDESC6123:0 "Just when it seemed that our fortifications couldn't get any better. One of our engineers came up with this great idea of triangular bastions. Not only do they look great, they also seem to slow down the enemy."
 EVTOPTA6123:0 "I guess I shouldn't complain"
 EVTNAME6124:0 "Fort falls into disrepair"
 EVTDESC6124:0 "A minor fortification has been neglected by our engineers and has fallen into disrepair. To be honest, at the moment it probably wouldn't even delay a party of school children, never mind an invading army."
 EVTOPTA6124:0 "Real men don't hide behind forts"
 EVTOPTB6124:0 "Perhaps some repairs are in order"
 EVTNAME6125:0 "Fort decays"
 EVTDESC6125:0 "Our Engineers have sadly neglected the condition of this fortification, unless an action is taken the fort will only offer minimal protection."
 EVTOPTA6125:0 "It isn't important"
 EVTOPTB6125:0 "There's nothing money can't solve"
 EVTNAME6126:0 "Fort crumbles"
 EVTDESC6126:0 "A recent audit has revealed that the walls of one of our fortifications are crumbling, while our engineering corps claims that there isn't enough money for repairs. If nothing is done its defensive ability will be reduced, however on the long term basis it might become a major tourist attraction in a few hundred years time, boosting the local economy."
 EVTOPTA6126:0 "Let's go for long term gain"
 EVTOPTB6126:0 "I think a more short term approach is in order"
 EVTNAME6127:0 "Fort Weakens"
 EVTDESC6127:0 "Poor maintenance work by Engineer Corps has left one of our more substantial fortifications with serious structural damage. For this fort to remain up to spec major structural work will be required."
 EVTOPTA6127:0 "Just punish a few of the people responsible"
 EVTOPTB6127:0 "No, let's spend the money"
 EVTNAME6128:0 "Complacent engineers"
 EVTDESC6128:0 "It has been discovered that one of our largest fortifications is no longer up to the job after a bout of complacency in our engineer corps."
 EVTOPTA6128:0 "If the experts are getting complacent I am sure things must be fine"
 EVTOPTB6128:0 "Action must be taken"
 EVTNAME6129:0 "Fortification Crisis"
 EVTDESC6129:0 "Neglect by our Engineer Corps has left one of our most powerful and modern fortification with a weakened wall. A besieging army may be able to exploit this."
 EVTOPTA6129:0 "The experts have spoken"
 EVTOPTB6129:0 "No! We will do something immediately"
 EVTNAME6130:0 "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions has been very successful, a new general has emerged."
 EVTOPTA6130:0 "Well, he shows promise"
 EVTNAME6131:0 "Nobility concerned with the loss of privileges"
 EVTDESC6131:0 "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131:0 "Does the nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131:0 "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better"
 EVTNAME6132:0 "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132:0 "Our Glorious Army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132:0 "Glory to us"
 EVTNAME6133:0 "Our Army has seen better days"
 EVTDESC6133:0 "The tarnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just aren't taking our army as seriously as before."
 EVTOPTA6133:0 "Time to shake things up then"
 EVTOPTB6133:0 "I don't think there is much that can be done"
 EVTNAME6134:0 "Our Merchants are adventuring"
 EVTDESC6134:0 "Current trading conditions are strongly favoring our merchants. Our merchants are ready to take advantage of these."
 EVTOPTA6134:0 "Excellent"
 EVTNAME6135:0 "Our Merchants are doing poorly"
 EVTDESC6135:0 "Although previously our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135:0 "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts"
 EVTOPTB6135:0 "A few unpopular reforms are the answer"
 EVTNAME6136:0 "Colonist Rush"
 EVTDESC6136:0 "Rumors of our Quest for the New World have led to more people readying themselves for a new life as a colonial settler."
 EVTOPTA6136:0 "They might be useful"
 EVTNAME6137:0 "People Flee to the Colonies"
 EVTDESC6137:0 "Our Quest for the New World has opened up opportunities for people in our colonies. The continuing war has convinced many of the best and brightest that the time to take these opportunities is now."
 EVTOPTA6137:0 "Let them go"
 EVTOPTB6137:0 "They must be stopped"
 EVTNAME6138:0 "Colonial Company founded"
 EVTDESC6138:0 "A Colonial Company has decided to expand a colony into an adjacent province."
 EVTOPTA6138:0 "This can only be good"
 EVTNAME6139:0 "Colonial Company goes bankrupt"
 EVTDESC6139:0 "One of colonial ventures has run into serious financial trouble, if no action is taken the colonists could suffer."
 EVTOPTA6139:0 "They knew the risks, it's not my problem"
 EVTOPTB6139:0 "Time for us to step in"
 EVTOPTA6140:0 "Excellent news"
 EVTNAME6141:0 "Trade Complacency"
 EVTDESC6141:0 "Although as a nation we are famous for our shrewd commerce practices, at the moment our merchants are becoming a tad complacent."
 EVTOPTA6141:0 "I can see our merchants not competing as well"
 EVTOPTB6141:0 "I think prices could be rising"
 EVTNAME6142:0 "Excellent Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6142:0 "Every so often a country is blessed with honest men working hard for the state. A number of good viceroys across our overseas holdings are giving us a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6142:0 "We are pleased to hear this"
 EVTNAME6143:0 "Corrupt Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6143:0 "Overseas provinces are notoriously too hard to police and good viceroys are essential. Sometimes though things don't work according to the plan, and corrupt and venal men end up in charge."
 EVTOPTA6143:0 "Take action"
 EVTOPTB6143:0 "Just turn a blind eye"
 EVTNAME6144:0 "Production Improvements"
 EVTDESC6144:0 "Our embracing of Smithian Economics has led to people spending time thinking about how things are produced. For the moment it seems to have paid off."
 EVTOPTA6144:0 "This is good"
 EVTNAME6145:0 "Production Stifled"
 EVTDESC6145:0 "Our producers become complacent as our use of Smithian Economics led to our production techniques being so advanced."
 EVTOPTA6145:0 "I think this will hurt production"
 EVTOPTB6145:0 "Actually it seems to have translated into higher prices"
 EVTNAME6146:0 "Successful Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6146:0 "On an annual basis bureaucracy gives the country a nice little tax boost, but sometimes the right men in the right place can give the country that little bit extra. It is a shame that a few years down the line you have to promote them beyond their ability."
 EVTOPTA6146:0 "Make hay while the sun shines"
 EVTNAME6147:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6147:0 "Bureaucracy sometimes just doesn't work. The wrong men in the wrong places can lead to corrupt practices which hurt the country's income. Even worse, it will take a few years to get the proper paperwork to change it."
 EVTOPTA6147:0 "You just can't fight the system"
 EVTNAME6148:0 "National Bank pays dividends"
 EVTDESC6148:0 "Several shrewd loans have led to very good profits at our National Bank. The bank is hiking its dividend and buying back some of its shares."
 EVTOPTA6148:0 "We're in the money"
 EVTNAME6149:0 "National Bank in trouble"
 EVTDESC6149:0 "Our National Bank is doing very poorly. It is finding it hard to lend to reliable people and is running into difficulties."
 EVTOPTA6149:0 "We'll give it some money to support it"
 EVTOPTB6149:0 "Tell the bank to lend to slightly less reliable people"
 EVTNAME6150:0 "Trade Policy Success"
 EVTDESC6150:0 "Our National Trade Policy is proving unusually successful at the moment. This is giving our merchants a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6150:0 "I am sure this is good news"
 EVTNAME6151:0 "Trade Policy is failing"
 EVTDESC6151:0 "Our National Trade Policy isn't really delivering at the moment. Our merchant just aren't doing as well."
 EVTOPTA6151:0 "Looks like the merchants are struggling"
 EVTOPTB6151:0 "We should grease the wheels a little more..."
 EVTNAME6152:0 "New Spy techniques"
 EVTDESC6152:0 "Our Espionage system is performing and our agents have found new ways to spy on people. Sooner or later our 'friends' and enemies will find out, but for the moment we have an edge."
 EVTOPTA6152:0 "I like edges"
 EVTNAME6153:0 "Spy Defections"
 EVTDESC6153:0 "Some of the spies in our espionage system are defecting to other countries. This could hurt us in the short term."
 EVTOPTA6153:0 "Let the disloyal elements go"
 EVTOPTB6153:0 "A small cash sum might change a few minds"
 EVTNAME6154:0 "Cabinet Dynamism"
 EVTDESC6154:0 "A combination of just the correct people in our cabinet can create conditions for a nice little boost in tax income. You will be pleased to hear that this has just happened."
 EVTOPTA6154:0 "This is good news indeed."
 EVTNAME6155:0 "Government Corruption"
 EVTDESC6155:0 "When the wrong men get into your cabinet it can mean bad news for the country, also it is difficult to remove them."
 EVTOPTA6155:0 "It looks like our taxes are dropping"
 EVTOPTB6155:0 "Inflation is on the rise"
 EVTNAME6156:0 "Minority Prospers"
 EVTDESC6156:0 "With their legal status guaranteed by our Bill of Rights, a minority is prospering under our rule."
 EVTOPTA6156:0 "Good to see"
 EVTNAME6157:0 "Backlash"
 EVTDESC6157:0 "Since we introduced the Bill of Rights many of our original ruling classes have been feeling marginalized, however rather than discuss it they seem to be staging a revolt."
 EVTOPTA6157:0 "Why don't they just discuss this like gentlemen?"
 EVTNAME6158:0 "The Clergy Mobilizes Population"
 EVTDESC6158:1 "For many years our policies have motivated a large majority of our population to dutifully attend the expected religious ceremonies. The clergy has shown its thanks for our supportive policy by in turn making supportive comments about our government."
 EVTOPTA6158:0 "May our people always find unity through faith."
 EVTNAME6159:0 "Religious Divergences"
 EVTDESC6159:0 "We are in many ways seen as one of the foremost defenders of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Our religious institutions are strong and priests both here and abroad flock to our seminars.\nIt is therefore somewhat embarrassing that the rural population in our country isn't quite as in tune with the theology as we are. Reports of deviations such as a dog being proclaimed a saint or old heathen festivals being integrated with the holy ceremonies of our faith is undermining our state."
 EVTOPTA6159:0 "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6159:0 "Attempt to make them abandon their ways."
 religious_deviants:0 "Religious Deviants"
 desc_religious_deviants:0 "By turning a blind eye on religious deviants around our country we have undermined the authority of our missionaries throughout our country.."
 EVTNAME6160:0 "Religious Zeal"
 EVTDESC6160:0 "Inspired by our fervent beliefs and religious policies, our missionaries are proving to be more convincing in their quiet chats with the unbelievers."
 EVTOPTA6160:0 "Time to spread the good news"
 EVTNAME6161:0 "Conservative Backlash"
 EVTDESC6161:0 "Our religious establishment doesn't feel that the nation is properly sticking to the principles of Divine Supremacy. We have heard them condemning the government."
 EVTOPTA6161:0 "It’s just idle talk from restless souls."
 EVTOPTB6161:0 "These dissidents must be dealt with!"
 EVTNAME6163:0 "His Holiness is concerned"
 EVTDESC6163:0 "Our Policy of tolerance to all faiths has led to some of our Catholic population deciding to embrace orthodoxy."
 EVTOPTA6163:0 "I guess I shouldn't be surprised"
 EVTNAME6164:0 "His Holiness is outraged"
 EVTDESC6164:0 "Taking advantage of our tolerant society, people have decided to embrace the Reformed Faith. The Papal nuncio has already expressed to us the concern of the Church."
 EVTOPTA6164:0 "Hey, live and let live"
 EVTNAME6165:0 "His Holiness is shocked"
 EVTDESC6165:0 "As we are an enlightened and tolerant society, some of our citizens have decided that the Catholic faith does not fit in with their current lifestyle choice and have decided instead to embrace Protestantism."
 EVTOPTA6165:0 "Well I am sure the Pope can live with this"
 EVTNAME6166:0 "The Orthodox Faith is Rocked"
 EVTDESC6166:0 "The Patriarch arrived today to express his anger that our policy of tolerance has allowed the schismatics who sacked holy Constantinople and abandoned the Roman Empire to spread their faith in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6166:0 "Is it really that bad?"
 EVTNAME6167:0 "The Patriarch is complaining"
 EVTDESC6167:0 "The Patriarch is concerned that we are showing too much tolerance when the news came the followers of Luther expanded their heretic beliefs in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6167:0 "These things happen"
 EVTNAME6168:0 "The Patriarch is concerned"
 EVTDESC6168:0 "The news has reached us today that Calvinism has spread in our realm. It seems that people are taking advantage of our tolerance to try out strange new faiths."
 EVTOPTA6168:0 "Well such is the price you pay for tolerance"
 EVTNAME6169:0 "Bishops feel we are losing ground"
 EVTDESC6169:0 "The Archbishop today arrived to express his dismay that our tolerance has led to people turning their back on the true faith and returning to Catholicism."
 EVTOPTA6169:0 "We are a modern state, these things happen"
 EVTNAME6170:0 "Bishops shocked"
 EVTDESC6170:0 "A delegation of senior bishops arrived today to discuss the effects of our continuing policy of tolerance for other faiths. They are especially concerned that the Orthodox faith is gaining ground in our country."
 EVTOPTA6170:0 "They should not be so backward"
 EVTNAME6171:0 "Bishops concerned"
 EVTDESC6171:0 "Our policy of tolerance has led to concerns amongst senior churchmen, since the news has reached us that the followers of Calvin are spreading their faith in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6171:0 "This is not a problem"
 EVTNAME6172:0 "Church Elders think the apocalypse is coming"
 EVTDESC6172:0 "Church elders believe that, as God has ordained, that our tolerant policies should be punished with our people converting to Catholicism, the apocalypse is surely just round the corner."
 EVTOPTA6172:0 "I think we should wait for a few more signs"
 EVTNAME6173:0 "God Punishing us?"
 EVTDESC6173:0 "Church Elders are of the opinion that our Merciful Lord is punishing us for the sinful policy of humanist tolerance. Certainly the Orthodox faith is advancing in our realm."
 EVTOPTA6173:0 "Would God really do that?"
 EVTNAME6174:0 "Church Elders concerned"
 EVTDESC6174:0 "Senior Elders in our church have expressed the opinion that the recent mass conversion to Protestantism was yet another sign of our Lord's divine wrath. Slightly more skeptical government officials think that our policy of tolerance may be a more likely cause."
 EVTOPTA6174:0 "I guess you reap what you sow"
 EVTNAME6175:0 "Ulema Concerned"
 EVTDESC6175:0 "The Ulema are increasingly concerned that we are being too tolerant to the schismatic followers of Ali. They feel that Allah the compassionate, the merciful, will be angered by this. Regardless, their faith is advancing in our country."
 EVTOPTA6175:0 "I am sure there will be no problems"
 EVTNAME6176:0 "Ayatollahs are concerned"
 EVTDESC6176:0 "A delegation of senior Ayatollahs advised us today that our policy of tolerance has allowed the advancement of Sunni Islam in our realm. They are concerned that this may delay the return of the Mahdi."
 EVTOPTA6176:0 "I'm sure he will return on time"
 EVTNAME6177:0 "Monks concerned"
 EVTDESC6177:0 "A delegation of senior Monks, after several days of meditation, have come to suggest that our tolerant policy is affecting the enlightenment of our realm. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Hindu faith."
 EVTOPTA6177:0 "This could harm some of our people's Karma"
 EVTNAME6178:0 "People turn to philosophy!"
 EVTDESC6178:0 "In a move that could rock the Karma of the whole nation, some of our people have decided to turn their back on the teachings of the Lord Buddha and instead embrace the teachings of a Chinese philosopher. Senior Monks believe that our policy of tolerance is the cause of this."

 EVTNAME6601:0 "The Revolution is here"
 EVTDESC6601:0 "The growing revolutionary activity in our country has caused the collapse of the regime. The revolutionary masses stormed a major prison in our capital and this sent shockwaves throughout the government. The offer to form a new, slightly more constitutional, monarchy was initially accepted, but then our old corrupt monarch just couldn't quite resist the urge to try and bring the good old days back. We were left with no choice but to limit the old King's ability to influence the government by removing his head. Although diehard monarchists were convinced that the King would soon grow another one, this was not the case. Now a purely temporary committee of public safety has been appointed, which includes the leaders of the initial revolution and an over-ambitious general. Our regime's future of liberty and equality at home would be bright but we seem to have annoyed every crowned head of Europe. Even now we hear reports that they are preparing for war against us, so we must now prepare to defend the republic. On the bright side, liberal forces are looking to us to export the benefits of the revolution to them, so we will be able to gain support in such a way."
 EVTOPTA6601:0 "Vive la Revolution"
 EVTNAME6602:0 "Defense of the revolution"
 EVTDESC6602:0 "The forces of reaction not only refuse to accept that our revolutionary government should be considered one of the family of Europe, but also deny our manifest right to spread our revolution to other needy countries. Our people are rallying to support the revolution."
 EVTOPTA6602:0 "We must fight on"
 EVTNAME6603:0 "The Revolution must be contained"
 EVTDESC6603:0 "The evil revolutionary government is not only doing vile things like removing feudal obligation, taxing the clergy and beheading nobles, but they are also exporting their revolutionary dogma to other countries, whether they want it or not. Right thinking people in our realm are rallying to the support of our divinely appointed monarch in his struggle against the great enemy."
 EVTOPTA6603:0 "We will overcome"
 EVTNAME6604:0 "The revolution is over"
 EVTDESC6604:0 "Reactionary forces have deposed the government of the people, replacing our godless revolutionary government with a divinely ordained King. People are dusting off all the old monarchist symbols."

 EVTNAME9600:0 "Submission of the Clergy"
 EVTDESC9600:0 "A proposition has been made to restrict the Church's authority and right to formulate laws regarding church affairs without the king or queen's consent. Although centralizing the monarch's power may have its benefits this will also separate us further from the Roman church."

 EVTNAME9550:0 "Trade Focus"
 EVTDESC9550:0 "Some members of our parliament feel that we're not putting enough focus on national trade. It's pretty clear to everyone that we're not exactly dominating trade in this area but we could certainly do worse, at least that's what the other members are claiming. If our previous track record is anything to go by, our parliament are not very likely to come to any sort of agreement anytime soon unless someone is able to talk some sense into them."

 EVTDESC9552:0 "Our parliament seems to have some real difficulties coming to terms with how to govern our nation, whether it's agreeing on a budget, taxes, port duties or trade and customs policies.

 EVTNAME9555:0 "Parliamentary Problems"
 EVTDESC9555:0 "$STATESMAN$ has been quite busy lately, proposing new changes, one after the other.

 EVTOPTA9555:0 "Find someone to replace $STATESMAN_S_PRONOUN$."
 EVTOPTB9555:0 "Give the advisor another chance"
 EVTNAME9556:0 "Heated Debates"
 EVTDESC9556:0 "Some members of the parliament are having some concerns regarding our increasingly bad reputation, they are claiming that it's having a negative effect on our trade relations. This question has been raised numerous times in the past but not that many have thought it of any consequence. This time the matter is causing some really heated debates though, perhaps we should try to settle things before they get out of hand."
 EVTOPTA9556:0 "That is probably wise"
 EVTOPTB9556:0 "It's not really a problem"
 EVTNAME9557:0 "Offense or Defense"
 EVTDESC9557:0 "The ongoing war has led to some serious conflicts in parliament. On the one side there are those arguing that there is nothing to be gained by allowing the war to drag on while others are convinced that there's no turning back. Unfortunately their inability to come to some sort of agreement does nothing to improve our current situation but rather the contrary."
 EVTOPTA9557:0 "Offense is probably the only option"
 EVTOPTB9557:0 "Defense sounds better at this stage"
 EVTNAME9558:0 "Conflicting Opinions"
 EVTDESC9558:0 "It seems there is always a small group of the parliament that can't agree with the others. Regardless of the matter at hand this particular group always have a different opinion than everyone else."
 EVTOPTA9558:0 "It's probably best to leave things as they are"
 EVTOPTB9558:0 "Some restructuring might be needed"
 EVTNAME9559:0 "An infiltrator in Parliament"
 EVTDESC9559:0 "There is a spy among us! Somehow a spy has managed to infiltrate our parliament and all of a sudden everyone is a suspect. We haven't managed to find out who sent him yet but since our relations with some of our neighbors are somewhat strained at the moment it was probably one of them."
 EVTOPTA9559:0 "That's not possible"
 EVTOPTB9559:0 "That's the only reasonable explanation"
 EVTNAME9560:0 "A Traitor in the Parliament"
 EVTDESC9560:0 "It would appear as though a member of our parliament has been selling secrets to our enemies. How would you otherwise explain the fact that they all of a sudden seem able to predict our every move? These were decisions that were never discussed outside the Parliament building."
 EVTOPTA9560:0 "Of course it was one of them"
 EVTOPTB9560:0 "It's better to play it safe until we know more"
 EVTNAME9561:0 "Political Chaos"
 EVTDESC9561:0 "Our Parliament's indecisiveness and inability to make any kind of decision has created near chaos. Every member is trying their utmost to get their voice heard but refusing to acknowledge the opinions of anyone else."
 EVTOPTA9561:0 "That's just the nature of politics"
 EVTOPTB9561:0 "Some restructuring might be necessary"
 EVTNAME9562:0 "Influenced Decisions"
 EVTDESC9562:0 "It has been brought to your attention that a certain member of our Parliament has been accepting bribes from several different sources for influencing all kinds of national decisions."
 EVTOPTA9562:0 "It has to stop"
 EVTOPTB9562:0 "That can't be true"
 EVTNAME9563:0 "Financial Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9563:0 "Our economy isn't what it has been. The treasury is almost empty and our parliament can't seem to figure out how to handle the situation or the reasons for it to happen in the first place. Minting more money is always an option of course or raising taxes, either way they are waiting for you to make a decision."
 EVTOPTA9563:0 "Mint more money"
 EVTOPTB9563:0 "Raise taxes"
 EVTNAME9564:0 "Military Spending"
 EVTDESC9564:0 "Some members of parliament are complaining that we're spending too much money on our military. Many of them are convinced that our production and trade will suffer if we don't cut back on military expenses."
 EVTOPTA9564:0 "Well, trade and production aren't as important"
 EVTOPTB9564:0 "Cut back on military expenses"
 EVTNAME9565:0 "A Strong Army or Navy?"
 EVTDESC9565:0 "Our Parliament is divided in regards to our military focus, some of them are advocating for a grand navy while others are more interested in a large army. Although some sort of middle way would be possible, most of them would prefer that we increased the size of our navy."
 EVTOPTA9565:0 "A large navy is the only option"
 EVTOPTB9565:0 "A large army would be more beneficial"
 EVTNAME9566:0 "Military Leniency"
 EVTDESC9566:0 "Some members of our parliament feel that we are too lenient when it comes to asserting control over what is rightfully ours. They can't understand how we can allow a core province like $PROVINCENAME$ to be controlled by some other country and just sit idly by."
 EVTOPTA9566:0 "They fail to see the bigger picture"
 EVTOPTB9566:0 "It's not of any interest anymore"
 EVTNAME9567:0 "Too many liberties"
 EVTDESC9567:0 "A few members of our parliament are of the opinion that $MONARCH$ has been taking a few too many liberties lately when it comes to governing our nation. Some are even claiming that $MONARCH$ seem to lack any respect whatsoever for both the constitution and the rest of the parliament."
 EVTOPTA9567:0 "They are exaggerating"
 EVTOPTB9567:0 "Take appropriate measurements"
 EVTNAME9568:0 "Economic Decisions"
 EVTDESC9568:0 "Our parliament is constantly exploring different ways to bring more money into our state treasury but as always there are disagreements regarding the best strategy. A heavy tax raise would improve the state of our treasury considerably but it is also very likely to upset the populace, a small raise on the other hand wouldn't improve our finances as much but wouldn't cause that many protests either."
 EVTOPTA9568:0 "A short-term solution is probably the best option"
 EVTOPTB9568:0 "Consider the long-term consequences"
 EVTNAME9569:0 "Military Expenses"
 EVTDESC9569:0 "Several members of our parliament are complaining that the costs of maintaining such a large army are too big for our current budget."
 EVTOPTA9569:0 "Convince them that we can afford it"
 EVTOPTB9569:0 "Agree to make some cutbacks"
 EVTNAME9570:0 "Sympathizers of the Old Government"
 EVTDESC9570:0 "It would appear as though a few members of our parliament still sympathize with the former government. Neither of them will admit it of course, but their behavior is rather suspicious at times. It might be a good idea to investigate where their real allegiances lay."
 EVTOPTA9570:0 "That won't be necessary"
 EVTOPTB9570:0 "Get to it"
 EVTNAME9571:0 "A New Constitution"
 EVTDESC9571:0 "Despite the considerable time and effort dedicated to the establishment of a new constitution, our parliament can't seem to agree on a common goal. So far, not a single proposition has been accepted by all parties and all normal activities have come to a standstill."
 EVTOPTA9571:0 "It will be solved soon enough"
 EVTOPTB9571:0 "Request some help"
 EVTNAME9572:0 "Areas of Research"
 EVTDESC9572:0 "Every member of our parliament is requesting more money to be invested in a different area. Our army needs funding but so does our trade and production and let's not forget about our navy."
 EVTOPTA9572:0 "An even spread should do the trick"
 EVTOPTB9572:0 "There's no need for any extra investments"
 EVTNAME9573:0 "Lack of Support"
 EVTDESC9573:0 "Some members of our parliament seem to think that $MONARCH$ has held his office long enough and are arguing for a new election. Apparently the reason for this is grounded in a disagreement they had with $MONARCH$ a short while ago regarding the implementation of a new financial reform."
 EVTOPTA9573:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTOPTB9573:0 "Agree to hear them out once more"
 EVTNAME9574:0 "Anxious Parliament"
 EVTDESC9574:0 "$SPYMASTER$, always being a rather suspicious person has managed to convince several members of parliament that a counter revolution is under works. $SPYMASTER_CAP_ADJ$ doesn't have any real evidence so far but most members seem to take $SPYMASTER_S_PRONOUN$ seriously and are therefore demanding appropriate measures to be taken."
 EVTOPTA9574:0 "It's nothing to worry about"
 EVTOPTB9574:0 "It's better to be safe than sorry"
 EVTNAME9575:0 "Troublesome Parliament"
 EVTDESC9575:0 "Our parliament seems to have some difficulties understanding who's in charge of our government. They seem to think it's fully acceptable to make decisions without either informing or discussing the matter with you first. Whatever gave them that idea?"
 EVTOPTA9575:0 "Make it a bit more clear to them"
 EVTOPTB9575:0 "Let them think they have a say in things"
 EVTNAME9576:0 "Overspending"
 EVTDESC9576:0 "$TREASURER$ has been complaining constantly for the last few weeks that we're spending more money than our budget allows. $TREASURER_CAP_ADJ$ has always been a bit overdramatic of course but this time $TREASURER_ADJ$ has even managed to convince some of the other members of parliament that it's a real problem."

 EVTOPTB9576:0 "Let $TREASURER_O_PRONOUN$ worry"
 EVTNAME9577:0 "Embezzlement"
 EVTDESC9577:0 "It's becoming more and more clear to you that there aren't that many members of the parliament that you can really trust. One of your closest advisors has just been exposed stealing money from the state treasury."
 EVTOPTA9577:0 "There's probably a good explanation for this"
 EVTOPTB9577:0 "Get rid of them"
 EVTNAME9578:0 "Planned Coup"
 EVTDESC9578:0 "According to some fairly trustworthy sources a few members of parliament are planning a coup to have $MONARCH$ replaced. It might be wise to investigate the matter further."

 EVTNAME1083:0 "Lacking Support"
 EVTDESC1083:0 "For reasons unknown, some of the cardinals have begun to question your decisions more and more lately, it almost seems like they are beginning to lose faith in your ability to govern the Catholic Church."
 EVTOPTA1083:0 "Hire someone to investigate the matter"
 EVTOPTB1083:0 "Just try to prove them wrong"
 EVTNAME1084:0 "Possible Infiltrator"
 EVTDESC1084:0 "According to one of your closest advisors, a spy has managed to infiltrate the Sacred College of Cardinals. Unless you think you can trust the advisor, perhaps you should ask them to provide you with some evidence?"
 EVTOPTA1084:0 "Take their word for it"
 EVTOPTB1084:0 "Ask for some proof"
 EVTNAME1090:0 "Too Much Religious Freedom"
 EVTDESC1090:0 "One of your advisors has asked you to consider the matter of religious freedom a bit more thoroughly. They are claiming that having a large group of people that doesn't adhere to our state religion is having a severe impact on our national stability."

 EVTOPTB1090:0 "It's not of any consequence"
 EVTNAME1091:0 "Problematic Relations"
 EVTDESC1091:0 "It has become a real issue for you that some of your neighbors refuse to accept the one true faith. Your relations are already far from ideal but this only makes matters worse."

 EVTOPTB1091:0 "Make preparations for a future attack"
 EVTNAME2060:0 "Missionary Falls Ill"
 EVTDESC2060:0 "The missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$ hasn't had much luck so far, news have just reached us that he has fallen ill. Any further work on the new church has come to a standstill and without his guidance the chances of converting the locals are rather slim."
 EVTOPTA2060:0 "Send someone to assist him"
 EVTOPTB2060:0 "Direct your efforts elsewhere"
 EVTNAME2061:0 "Religious Resistance"
 EVTDESC2061:0 "It is proving much harder than anticipated to convert the citizens of $PROVINCENAME$. Although a few of them showed some clear interest in the beginning, the majority don't seem that willing to embrace a new religion."
 EVTOPTA2061:0 "Increase your efforts"
 EVTOPTB2061:0 "It's a waste of time"
 EVTNAME2062:0 "Native Attack"
 EVTDESC2062:0 "We have just received news regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the report he and his followers were attacked by natives just a short while ago. Unfortunately it's not clear if they managed to drive the attackers away or if they still pose a threat."

 EVTOPTB2062:0 "They can probably handle this themselves"
 EVTNAME2063:0 "Religious Uproar"
 EVTDESC2063:0 "According to the governor of $PROVINCENAME$, the citizens are in uproar because of our missionaries' complete lack of respect for any religious practices or traditions different from their own. He is asking us to consider canceling all further missionary activities in the area or at least send some more troops until things calm down a bit."
 EVTOPTA2063:0 "Send some troops"
 EVTOPTB2063:0 "It's not of much importance"
 EVTNAME2064:0 "Wicked Rumors"
 EVTDESC2064:0 "There are some very disturbing rumors circulating regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the rumors he never used the money we gave him to finance the construction of a new church but kept it all to himself. Who would have thought such a godly man could be capable of such a thing."

 EVTNAME6024:0 "Chaos in Neighboring Country"

 EVTNAME712:0 "Dramatic Currency Revaluation"

 EVTNAME806:0 "Country Destabilized"
 EVTDESC806:0 "Our decision to strengthen the state at the cost of regional interests has left a bit of a gap in local politics. Since there are no local potentates to tell them everything is fine, the people have started to believe they are being badly governed."

 EVTNAME807:0 "Large Revolt"
 EVTDESC807:0 "Although we are well aware that no one likes paying taxes, you would think that people would have the sense to realize that glorious victories on the battlefield require a little more taxation. It seems we will have to explain it to them."
 EVTOPTB807A:0 "Target practice"
 EVTNAME808:0 "Local Pretender Rises"
 EVTDESC808:0 "In order to ensure the glory of our country we have had to restrict local privileges. The problem with privileges is that people get very attached to them for sentimental reasons.

 EVTOPTB808A:0 "Off with his head!"

 EVTOPTB809A:0 "Excellent work"
 EVTNAME810:0 "More Local Recruiting"
 EVTDESC810:0 "Our decision to ensure that local privileges will be honored has meant that peasants are keen to defend their villages. This in turn has the added benefit of people being less resentful about serving in our military."

 EVTNAME811:0 "Stability Increase"

 EVTOPTB811A:0 "Good news"
 EVTNAME812:0 "Peasant Revolt"
 EVTDESC812:0 "One of the good things about serfdom is that by ensuring that peasants cannot move around they become easier to tax. However, some peasants seem to have issues with this just and natural policy, so they have foolishly decided to revolt."
 EVTOPTB812A:0 "Kill them All!"
 EVTNAME813:0 "Attracting the right people"
 EVTDESC813:0 "Our decision to improve the lot of our serfs by making sure they are properly looked after has created more opportunities for men to show what they can do - perhaps one will even approach true greatness."
 EVTOPTB813A:0 "This is good"
 EVTNAME814:0 "Major Revolt"
 EVTDESC814:0 "Our Peasants are deeply upset at the news that their freedom of movement is to be further restricted. In fact, there have been massive revolts across our country because of this... Perhaps if they took the time to care for their personal hygiene they would not be so revolting? "
 EVTOPTB814A:0 "The peasants are revolting!"
 EVTNAME815:0 "People are disappearing"
 EVTDESC815:0 "Since we have made it easier for the peasants to move around in search of better farming opportunities, it has, unfortunately, been more difficult to track them down when the army needs recruits."
 EVTOPTA815:0 "Not ideal this"
 EVTNAME816:0 "Losing control"
 EVTDESC816:0 "With our new laws that tie the peasantry less firmly to the land, it seems that they are also getting strange new ideas about their precise role in the grand scheme of things."
 EVTOPTB816A:0 "This is a worrying development"
 EVTNAME817:0 "Better Administration"
 EVTDESC817:0 "By reining in the nobility in their ruthless exploitation of the peasantry, so called 'gentleman farmers' have become surprisingly common in the administration. This, in turn, has improved general conditions in our country."
 EVTOPTB817A:0 "Progress!"
 EVTNAME818:0 "Dangerous ideas are spreading!"
 EVTDESC818:0 "Our slightly less dogmatic thinking has led to new and strange notions of 'humanism'. This is a cause for deep concern, since people are starting to question the proper order of things."
 EVTOPTB818A:0 "We are concerned."
 EVTNAME819:0 "We look weak"
 EVTDESC819:0 "Properly civilized countries do not allow petty commoners to attempt any kind of serious thought. The eyes of the world are upon us, and the world does not like what it sees."
 EVTOPTB819A:0 "It is temporary"
 EVTNAME820:0 "New thinkers arise"
 EVTDESC820:0 "Our generous policies allowing people more freedom of speech have created a fertile breeding ground for promising new ideas. Some of the prominent new thinkers might become great men, who will eventually leave our nation with a lasting legacy of intellectual growth."
 EVTOPTB820A:0 "We have chosen wisely"
 EVTNAME821:0 "Heresy"

 EVTOPTB821A:0 "Weeds in the garden..."
 EVTNAME822:0 "Disorder"
 EVTDESC822:1 "Not everybody agrees with our religious doctrine. Some people are complaining loudly, calling our approach to modern ideas narrow-minded and arguing that clinging to ancient philosophy is regressive nonsense."
 EVTOPTB822A:0 "Alas, some might have to burn..."
 EVTNAME823:0 "A Holy Person Has Arrived"
 EVTDESC823:1 "A person from a holy order arrived at court today, impressed with our harsh, but just and Godly, punishment of heretics and unbelievers. They have asked for an advisory position, stating that a [Root.GovernmentName] that prays together will stay together."
 EVTOPTB823A:0 "Let me think about this."
 EVTNAME830:0 "Nobles are worried"
 EVTDESC830:0 "Our nobles with estates close to the frontier are concerned that we are neglecting our defenses. They have voiced their worries to all and sundry."
 EVTOPTB830A:0 "But attack is the best form of defense!"
 EVTNAME831:0 "Too many cowards"
 EVTDESC831:0 "Our increasing focus on offensive doctrine has made it harder to find brave peasants to fill the ranks. Ridiculous complaints about being cannon fodder are frequently spouted to our recruitment officers."
 EVTOPTB831A:0 "The fools are missing out on glory"
 EVTNAME832:0 "Glory to us"
 EVTDESC832:0 "Our decision to focus on offense has led too many of our neighbors looking enviously and worriedly at our glorious troops, who stand ready to give our enemies a taste of cold steel."
 EVTOPTB832A:0 "Indeed"
 EVTNAME833:0 "Aristocrats don't want to serve"
 EVTDESC833:0 "Our Aristocrats are becoming reluctant to serve in our army since we are focusing on defensive tactics. They are concerned about the lack of opportunities for glory while cowering behind fortifications."
 EVTOPTB833A:0 "They just don't understand"
 EVTOPTB833B:0 "A little gold will convince them"
 EVTNAME834:0 "Peasants upset"
 EVTDESC834:0 "With our increasing focus on defense, we have been clearing land around our fortifications to dig moats and create clear fields of fire. The people occupying some of the land have reacted in a most disloyal manner."
 EVTOPTB834A:0 "Well, the fort should hold out till relief arrives."
 EVTNAME835:0 "Fortification Expert"
 EVTDESC835:0 "Since we have started to focus on more defensive philosophies, a humble engineer (a position usually at the bottom of the rung in the military) has had a chance to impress with the mark of true genius."
 EVTOPTB835A:0 "He is pretty good I guess"
 EVTNAME836:0 "Naval thought suffering"
 EVTDESC836:0 "With our attention shifting further from the Navy to the Army, some of our master shipwrights have decided to seek employment elsewhere. This has caused our shipyards to suffer."
 EVTOPTB836A:0 "To be expected"
 EVTNAME837:0 "Naval Officers are retiring"
 EVTDESC837:0 "Our decision to start favoring the Army more has led to a crop of promising young naval officers to retire from service. They claim that there are not as many opportunities for advancement as there used to be."
 EVTOPTB837A:0 "Damn"
 EVTNAME838:0 "An example to us all"
 EVTDESC838:0 "As the Army is starting to enjoy the fruits of our increased favor, many young officers are looking for opportunities to distinguish themselves. One captain in particular stands out - he even cuts a striking figure!"
 EVTOPTB838A:0 "Interesting."
 EVTNAME839:0 "Arsenals are being deserted"
 EVTDESC839:0 "Since we have decided to increase our focus on naval matters, our military arsenals supplying the Army are being deserted. Experienced craftsmen are seeking employment elsewhere."
 EVTOPTB839A:0 "Disappointing"
 EVTNAME840:0 "General retires"
 EVTDESC840:0 "The recent decision to favor the Navy more has caused several generals to seek retirement. They feel that there will be less glory for them."
 EVTOPTB840A:0 "Oh well"
 EVTNAME842:0 "Unsuitable recruits"
 EVTDESC842:0 "Since we have felt it necessary to tighten up the quality standards of our army, a whole host of potential recruits must regrettably be declared unfit for duty."
 EVTOPTB842A:0 "We must separate the wheat from the chaff "
 EVTNAME843:0 "Nobles worried"
 EVTDESC843:0 "With our army increasingly focused on quality, the nobles are concerned that the traditional army - loyal to them first and the country second - is gone forever. Fortunately, they are even more worried that this new model army will prove a most compelling argument against any overly loud complaints..."
 EVTOPTB843A:0 "There is nothing to worry about"
 EVTNAME844:0 "New commandant"
 EVTDESC844:0 "Since we are looking for a more disciplined army, our commandants are working hard at making sure our troops are drilled to perfection. One man in particular shows real promise."
 EVTOPTB844A:0 "Very Good"
 EVTNAME845:0 "People laugh at our army"
 EVTDESC845:0 "Although the decision to go for a massed army makes sense to many inside our country, uncouth foreigners are laughing at us, saying our army is nothing but an undisciplined mob."
 EVTOPTB845A:0 "Let them laugh."
 EVTNAME846:0 "Leaders harder to find"
 EVTDESC846:0 "We have made the wise decision to favor quantity over quality. However, the new larger army has the unforeseen problem of finding it harder to spot officers of talent among the masses."
 EVTOPTB846A:0 "Things will no doubt improve"
 EVTNAME847:0 "New organization"
 EVTDESC847:0 "Some thought that our decision to favor quantity over quality was foolish, that it would lead to a decline in leadership, or even make our army a bit of a joke - but they were wrong. Our new larger army has unlocked the talents of our military minds, leading to ever better levels of organization."
 EVTOPTB847A:0 "Nice "
 EVTNAME729:0 "Improve the Capital"
 EVTDESC729:0 "The glory of our capital has long been neglected. We now have an opportunity to improve the city and make it a beacon of cultural pride. This may prove costly, but there is an alternative solution."
 EVTOPTA729:0 "Use the Military as Workforce"
 EVTOPTB729:0 "Spend Money"
 EVTNAME730:0 "Land Technology Research Useless"
 EVTDESC730:0 "Several prominent men in our country are pointing out that the path we are going when it comes to army research is utterly foolish and will amount to nothing. They demand that we stop the current approach and stick with what was good enough for our fathers."
 EVTOPTA730:0 "They have a point!"
 EVTOPTB730:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME731:0 "Naval Research Wrong!"
 EVTDESC731:0 "It seems as if a leading shipwright in our country has written a very convincing document detailing how the new ship technology, that his rival has been trying to get funding for, will never work, and may even cause the ships to sink before they leave the harbor."
 EVTOPTA731:0 "They must be right!"
 EVTOPTB731:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME732:0 "New Trade Research is Heretical"
 EVTDESC732:0 "We have had complaints from several dignitaries in our country that the new practices of our merchants are clearly heretical, and that we should put a stop to them."

 EVTOPTB732:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME733:0 "Production Research Flawed"

 EVTOPTB733:0 "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME734:0 "There should be a Stable Government"
 EVTDESC734:0 "Several of the leading members of the government are deeply worried about some changes proposed to how the realm should be ruled.

 EVTNAME737:0 "Local fortification expert discovered"

 EVTOPTA737:0 "The entire country needs him"
 EVTOPTB737:0 "Let him stay home"
 EVTNAME738:0 "Naive Relative"

 EVTNAME741:0 "Printing Press gives Benefits"
 EVTDESC741:0 "Since the invention of the printing press, more and more books, about an ever wider range of subjects, have been published. We can now see the benefit of this, since knowledge spreads faster and more ideas are appearing amongst our philosophers and natural scientists."
 EVTOPTA741:0 "Good News!"
 EVTNAME742:0 "Extraordinary Recruiting Policies"
